@article{Hills:2019aa,
	Abstract = {In addition to improving quality of life, higher subjective wellbeing leads to fewer health problems and higher productivity, making subjective wellbeing a focal issue among researchers and governments. However, it is difficult to estimate how happy people were during previous centuries. Here we show that a method based on the quantitative analysis of natural language published over the past 200 years captures reliable patterns in historical subjective wellbeing. Using sentiment analysis on the basis of psychological valence norms, we compute a national valence index for the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany and Italy, indicating relative happiness in response to national and international wars and in comparison to historical trends in longevity and gross domestic product. We validate our method using Eurobarometer survey data from the 1970s and demonstrate robustness using words with stable historical meanings, diverse corpora (newspapers, magazines and books) and additional word norms. By providing a window on quantitative historical psychology, this approach could inform policy and economic history.},

	abstract = {The ARDC is organising a couple of public forums to help gather researcher requirements for the Trove component of the HASS RDC. One of the roundtables will look at ‘Existing tools that utilise Trove data and APIs’. Last year I wrote a summary of what the GLAM Workbench can contribute to the development of humanities research infrastructure, particularly in regard to Trove. I thought it might be useful to update that list to include recent additions to the GLAM Workbench, as well as a range of other datasets, software, tools, and interfaces that exist outside of the GLAM Workbench.},
