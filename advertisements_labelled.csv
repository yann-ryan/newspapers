No- body can  doubt  the  vast  importance  attached  by  the  Czar  to  the  preservation  of  Sebastopol  and  of  the  fleet  which  sleeps  beneath  the  waters  of  its  har- bour. The  unceasing  exertions  and  dreadful  sacri- fices of  Russia  attest  it  only  too  well.  To  save  the  place  was  the  point  of  honour  of  the  empire—the  one  object,  compared  with  which  all  others  seemed  puny  and  insignificant.  Yet,  even  in  this  crisis  of  his  destiny,  the  Emperor  of  Russia  could  despatzli  probably  his  best  General  and  an  army  whose  bravery  is  only  too  well  attested  by  its  enormous  and  almost  incredible  losses  on  the  29th  of  Septem- ber, not  to  defend  his  own  frontier,  but  make  a  hostile  inroad  into  the  Turkish  territory,  and  to  possess  himself  of  a  city  situated  in  a  mountainous  region  and  exposed  to  an  inclement  climate.  So  eager  was  Mouravieff  for  the  prize,  and  so  deter- mined to  win  at  all  costs,  that  se  soon  as  lie  heard  of  the  fall  of  Sebastopol,  attributing  to  the  allied  Generals  a  degree  of  foresight  and  activity  which  they  were  very  far  indeed  from  possessing,  ho  deemed  it  necessary  to  anticipate,  at  whatever  cost,  the  expedition  they  wore  sure  to  make,  and  so  sustained  a  repulse  which  cost  him  a  third  of  his  army.  Had  ho  known  the  easy  and  comfortable  tactics  of  the  allies  ho  might  have  saved  his  even,  and  taken  the  city  just  as  well  ;  but  it  would  be  ungracious  to  blame  an  enemy  for  thinking  bettor  of  us  than  we  deserve.  What  now  presses  for  consideration  is  whether  we  are  tamely  to  sit  down  with  this  loss  ;  whether  that  which  the  Russian  General  has  gained  through  our  negligence  he  is  to  be  allowed  to  keep  through  our  supineness  and  want  of  enterprise.  If  we  are  ■ot  to  have  peace  we  must  seek  out  some  vulner- able point  in  which  we  may  strike  Russia  between  the  joints  of  her  armour,—some  place  in  which  a  victory  may  give  us  something  more  than  a  barren  triumph,  and  draw  after  it  other  results  than  inter- minable catalogues  of  killed  and  wounded.  While  Sebastopol  was  untaken  we  considered  it  so  indis- putably the  first  object  of  the  war  that  we  were  well  satisfied  to  sacrifice  everything  else  to  its  at- tainment. The  struggle  was  so  gigantic,  our  in- terests and  our  honour  were  so  obviously  at  stake,  that  no  success,  however  great,  could  compensate  us  for  any  delay  or  any  failure  there.  But,  Sebas- topol once  taken,  a  campaign  in  the  Crimea  has  no  other  object  than  the  capture  or  destruction  of  the  Russian  troops  encamped  within  the  penin- sula. The  Crimea  itself,  except  as  a  battle-ground,  is  utterly  worthless,  and  we  are  only  justified  in  remaining  there  on  the  supposition  that  there  we  can  inflict  more  serious  wounds  on  Russia  than  elsewhere.  Whether  this  be  so  or  not  we  cannot  judge.  Unless  the  coming  campaign  is  to  open  with  a  spirit  and  a  brilliancy  very  different  from  the  close  of  its  predecessor,  200,000  men  could  not  be  more  entirely  thrown  away  than  in  occupying  the  plateau  between  Kamiesh  and  Balaklava.  Of  this,  at  any  rate,  we  may  feel  confident—that  an  expeditionary  army  can  well  be  spared  to-coperate  with  Omer  Pasha  in  the  Transcaucasian  provinces,  and  to  redeem  the  fallen  honour  of  the  allies  in  the  estimation  of  the  semi-civilised  Courts  of  Asia.  We  are  making  war  as  mach  against  Russian  pres- tige as  Russian  power,  and  cannot  afford  to  allow  her,  by  easy  Asiatic  successes,  to  obliterate  the  effect  of  European  defeats  inflicted  upon  her  at  so  tremendous  a  cost.  We  know  not  what  other  field  is  left  for  our  enterprise.  To  march  into  the  deso- late interior  would  bo  to  follow  the  steps  of  Charles  XII.  and  Sweden  to  certain  destruction.  The  capture  of  Nicolaieff  may  hardly  repay  its  cost  while  we  hold  the  narrow  passage  through  which  alone  the  ships  built  at  its  dockyards  can  find  their  way  into  the  sea  ;  but  in  the  rich  and  beau- tiful valley  that  lies  between  the  opposing  ranges  of  the  Caucasus  and  Ararat,  with  its  glittering  streams,  its  emerald  meadows,  its  waving  beech  woods,  its  snow-capped  mountains,  we  have  a  land  peculiarly  adapted  for  the  operations  of  an  Euro- pean force.  In  the  north  towards  the  Kouban  are  Mussulman  tribes  who,  it  is  supposed,  would  fly  to  arms  if  a  Turkish  division  were  sent  among  them,  and  the  banks  of  the  Phasis  and  the  Cyrus  are  inhabited  by  races  ivh  o  would  gladly  welcome  and  heartily  sup- port a  Christian  deliverer.  To  cut  off  the  garrison  ,  of  Kars  from  all  communication  with  Russia,  to  close  the  passes  of  the  Caucasus,  to  scale  the  ascent  which  leads  to  the  tableland  of  Georgia,  to  drive  the  Russians  before  us  through  Teflis  to  the  very  shores  of  the  Caspian  Sea,  are  enterprises  the  re- sults of  which  would  be  enormous,  but  the  difficulty  of  which  would  bs  by  no  means  so  great  as  those  over  which  we  have  already  triumphed.  Resting  on  our  fleet  and  a  friendly  population  as  a  secure  basis  of  operations,  it  would  be  easy  for  the  allies  to  wrest  from  the  hands  of  the  Russians  the  com- mand of  the  Caspian  Sea,  and  to  restore  to  Persia  that  of  which  Russia  has  deprived  her—the  right  of  navigating  what  must  in  all  fairness  be  considered  her  waters.  Either  we  must  be  prepared  to  enter  on  some  such  enterprise  as  this,  or  to  leave  the  Emperor  in  possession  of  his  present  conquests,  and  in  a  condition  to  push  them  further  so  soon  as  he  shall  be  relieved  from  the  vast  concentration  of  his  forces  which  the  contest  for  the  possession  of  Sebas- topol had  rendered  necessary.  The  affairs  of  Asia  cannot  be  left  as  they  are  ;  there,  and  there  alone,  Russia  is  still  able  to  assume  the  offensive,  and  will  infallibly  attain  more,  unless  we  take  away  from  her  that  which  she  now  has.  Lot  it  not  be  supposed  that  in  suggesting  a  cam- paign in  the  Transcaucasian  provinces  we  are  ,  actuated  by  any  desire  meanly  and  selfishly  to  employ  the  power  of  France  to  carry  out  merely  English  objects  ;  we  repeat  what  we  have  so  often  said—that  we  have  no  fear  whatever  from  Russia  for  our  Indian  empire.  Nothing  that  she  has  done  in  this  war  raises  our  opinion  of  her  as  an  aggressive  Power,  and  in  India  she  would  be  en- countered by  a  combination  of  obstacles  far  more  formidable  than  any  which  she  has  hitherto  been  called  upon  to  surmount.  We  have  no  wish  to  in- volve ourselves  in  the  maze  of  Central  Asian  in- trigues. We  have  no  wish  for  any  increase  of  territory  to  the  north  of  the  Himalayas.  All  our  objects  would  be  strictly  common  to  us  with  our  ally.  We  wish  to  strike  Russia  in  the  most  vul- nerable point.  We  wish  to  oppose  to  her  future  aggression  the  rugged  barrier  of  the  Caucasus  and  the  still  more  rugged  valour  of  its  tribes.  We  wish  to  prevent  her  from  practising  upon  Persia  those  arts  and  those  menaces  which  so  nearly  suc- ceeded against  Turkey.  We  are  no  more  disposed  to  tolerate  her  presence  at  Teheran  than  at  Con•  stantinople  or  Hammerfest.  We  would  not  allow  Russia  to  turn  the  left  flank  of  Turkey  by  the  Balkan—we  must  not  permit  her  to  turn  the  right,  which  now  lies  open  to  her  by  way  of  the  valleys  of  the  Tigris  and  the  Euphrates.  We  have  stopped  her  external  commerce  ;  it  is  time  wo  applie  d  a  tourniquet  to  he  r  main  artery,—the  vast  flood  of  the  Volga.  Th  ese  thi  ngs  mus  t  be  done,  not  in  the  interest  of  England  alone,  but  in  that  of  the  world.  A  solid  peace  can  only  be  founded  on  the  conviction  of  the  power  of  the  Allies,  and  that  conviction  will  then  be  most  surely  pro  d  uc  ed  when  we  employ  our  strength  at  those  points,  not  where  our  enesty  is  most,  but  where  he  is  least,  prepared  to  receive  us.  The  Pkare  de  la  Manche  announces  that  30,000  or  40,000  men  will  probably  be  encamped  this  winter  i❑  the  neighbourhood  of  Cherbourg  for  the  purpose  of  being  embarked  next  spring  for  the  Russian  Baltic  pro- vinces. The  establishment  of  another  camp  of  20,000  men,  near  Brest,  is  &amp;aa  talked  of. ",newspapers//0002194/1855/1228/0002194_18551228_mets.xml,advertisement

This  day  being  the  25th  anniversary  of  the  Polish  in- surrection of  1830,  the  Polish  exiles  resident  in  London  attended  the  funeral  service  at  the  Roman  Catholic  chapel,  Sutton-street,  Soho-square,  for  the  repose  of  their  countrymen  who  fell  in  this  and  other  national  struggles,  after  which  they  assembled  in  Sussex  Cham- bers, Duke-street,  St.  James's,  where  a  meeting  was  held.  Colonel  Chevalier  WIEROINSKI  occupied  the  chair,  and  in  opening  the  proceedings  warned  his  countrymen  to  be  on  their  guard  against  the  Polish  doctrinaires,  who  maintain  that  the  present  is  not  the  time  for  the  Poles  to  take  any  part  in  the  war  against  Russia.  Eighty-six  years  of  the  most  dreadful  national  calamities—four  par- titions, and  the  dungeons  of  the  spoliators  are  filled  with  Polish  martyrs  ;  and  while  in  all  parts  of  the  world  the  bones  of  Poles  bleached  on  every  battle-field,  and  the  Polish  blood  flows  profusely  everywhere,  these  cold  cal- culators tell  you  now  it  is  not  yet  time.  Oh  !  my  brethren  !—(continued  he)—Now,  and  now  only,  is  the  right  time  to  show  to  Europe  and  to  the  world  that  Po- land is  not  dead—that  she  is  ready  to  perform  her  old  task  of  watching  over  and  shielding  the  liberties  and  the  independence  of  the  civilised  part  of  Europe.  Captain  CHAS.  SZULCZEWSKI  proposed  the  first  reso- lution, which  was  as  follows  :  That  the  Polish  exiles  in  this  meeting  a'sembled  de- clare solemnly  and  conscientiously,  on  behalf  not  only  of  themselves,  but  also  of  their  countrymen,  whether  dragged  unwillingly  to  serve  in  the  armies  of  the  Czar,  or  subject  in  their  homes  to  the  degrading  oppression  of  his  govern- ment, that  the  resolution  of  the  whole  Polish  nation  again  to  constitute  itself  into  an  independent  State,  openly  asserted  iu  arms  this  day  25  years  ago,  so  far  from  having  been  shaken  or  diminished  by  the  unparalleled  civil  and  religious  persecution  which  the  Polish  people  have  suffered  in  the  meantime,  has  become,  on  the  other  hand,  oven  yet  more  deep,  unwavering,  and  immutable.  In  proof  of  which  solemn  declaration  they  appeal  to  the  indisputable  fact  that  Polish  prisoners  taken  during  the  present  war,  to  wh  ttever  class  of  life  they  may  belong,  seize  with  avi- dity the  first  opportunity  offered  them  of  entering  the  ranks  of  the  allies,  and  fighting  against  their  former  After  observing  that  the  vitality  of  the  national  spirit,  and  the  devotion  of  the  Poles  for  their  country,  have  not  suffered  any  diminution,  continued  thus  :  Since  the  ultimate  downfall  of  Poland  in  1831—since  the  event  that  made  us  all  exiles,  we  have  never  met  to  commemorate  that  event  under  such  important  circum- stances for  us  as  the  present.  There  have  been,  since  then,  it  is  true,  various  periods  of  great  commotion  in  Europe,  which  have.  raised  our  hopes  and  made  us  put  forth  new  energies  ;  but  at  those  periods  the  wisest  among  us  were  always  fully  aware  that  if  we  were  to  succeed  it  would  be  in  spite  of  governments,  armed  with  an  extent  of  national  power  which  their  sympathis- ing subjects  did  not  possess,  and  that,  therefore,  our  chances  of  success  were  so  much  the  less,  and  were,  indeed,  dependent  upon  the  overthrow  of  those  governments.  Now,  however,  it  is  very  different.  Though  not  avowedly,  and  not  even  designedly,  the  mightiest  powers  of  Europe  are  now  leagued  to- gether to  do  battle  for  Poland—for  whoever  fights  against  Russia  fights  for  Poland  ;  and,  though  timid  politicians  may  shrink  from  acknowledging  it,  the  restoration  of  Poland  must  be  one  of  the  consequences  of  the  present  war,  or  the  war  will  prove  to  have  been  waged  in  vain.  Now,  therefore,  it  is  not  only  the  popular  sympathies  but  the  governments  of  Europe  that  are  enlisted  in  our  cause,  and  the  governments  of  Europe,  backed  by  the  enormous  strength  bestowed  by  the  full  and  hearty  con- currence of  their  people,  and  the  restoration  of  Poland  has  become  one  of  the  essential  conditions  for  the  resto- ration of  peace  in  Europe.  But,  if  this  be  so,  fellow- countrymen and  fellow-exiles,  the  part  we  have  to  per- form and  the  duties  we  have  to  fulfil  are  also  different,  and  it  behoves  us  to  take  a  serious  view  of  our  position,  and  to  make  up  our  minds  to  consider  no  sacrifice  too  great  to  secure,  when  the  time  comes,  the  open  and  willing  aid  and  co-operation  of  those  who  are  now  perhaps  only  fighting  our  battle  because  they  cannot  help  it.  While  addressing  you  on  a  recent  melancholy  occasion,  when  we  had  met  to  do  honour  to  the  memory  of  the  truest  and  noblest  friend  that  any  oppressed  nation  could  ever  boast  of,  Lord  Dudley  Stuart,  I  took  the  liberty  of  alluding  to  the  unmerited  reputation  for  disunion  which  has  ever  clung  to  us  as  re  nation,  and  to  the  diversity  of  opinions  entertained  in  the  emigra- tion as  to  what  ought  to  be  the  form  of  government  in  Poland,  should  our  beloved  country  ever  be  restored  to  independence.  I  would  now  fain  dwell  further  upon  the  subject,  and  beg  you  to  reflect  that  if  the  hopes  which  have  been  so  frequently  frustrated  should  at  length  be  realised  as  a  consequence  of  the  present  war,  our  country  will,  in  this  ease,  have  been  restored  through  the  aid  of  a  European  coalition  ;  and  that,  as  has  been  truly  observed  by  our  countryman  Count  Valerian  Krasinski,  in  one  of  the  many  works  which  have  made  his  name  illustrious  in  exile—we  cannot,  therefore,  expect  that  the  form  of  Government  to  be  introduced  among  us  will  be  left  en- tirely to  our  own  decision.  What  we  have  to  do  now,  in  expectation  of  the  propitious  event  is,  therefore,  to  train  our  minds  to  acquiesce  readily  in  whatever  neces- sities the  conjunctures  of  the  times  may  impose,  and  to  sacrifice  even  cherished  theories  and  predilections  in  the  cause  for  which  we  have  made  so  many  other  sacrifices.  To  do  this  will,  I  think,  be  the  more  easy,  if  we  will  but  ,  take  an  unbiassed  survey  of  the  world's,  history  ant  ob- serve, that  no  nation  was  ever  founded  and  no  state  ever  developed  itself  according  to  political  theories.  The  principles  of  a  nation's  growth,  the  elements  of  its  great- ness, lie  hidden  in  the  innermost  recesses  of  its  being,  as,  also,  in  the  nature  of  the  country  which  it  inhabits.  To  seek  out,  to  recognise,  and  to  nourish  these,  is  the  task  of  the  patriot  and  the  statesman—- and we  have  all  been  so  long  absent  from  our  country,  so  many  forces  of  which  we  have  hardly  any  know- ledge have  been  in  action  there  during  our  quarter  of  a  century  of  exile,  that,  should  we  over  be  restored  to  it,  we  would  have  much  to  learn  before  we  could  be  in  a  position  to  judge  what  would  be  the  best  possible  form  of  government  for  us.  That,  in  the  first  instance,  it  would  be  sufficiently  free  to  allow  of  its  being  gradually  improved  we  have  a  guarantee  in  the  principles  that  govern  the  present  war,  and  render  it  so  popular  throughout  Europe  ;  and  with  this  assurance  we  ought  to  rest  contented  for  the  present  ;  for,  to  recommence  our  national  life  with  dissensions  on  the  subject  of  preconceived  theories,  whose  adaptation  to  the  circum- stances of  the  country  we  had  had  no  means  of  test- ing, would,  indeed,  be  to  prove  that  the  early  dis  cords  that  have  made  our  intestine  broils  proverbial  in  Europe  did  not  spring  from  our  old  absurd  constitution,  hut  in  reality  had  their  root  in  the  national  character.  On  the  other  hand,  by  discarding  all  subjects  which  have  hitherto  proved  apples  of  di,cord  amongst  us,  by  work- ing together  with  one  heart  and  one  hand,  and  bringing  all  our  energies  to  bear  on  the  first  great  task  before  us  —the  reconquest  of  our  country  by  faithful  service  iu  the  armies  that  are  now  combating  Russia  —we  shall,on  our  side,  be  giving  the  best  gu  a  r  a  ntees  for  the  fut  ure,  we  shall  be  acqui  r  i  ng  th  e  esteem  of  those  Governments  without  whose  aid  we  can  hope  to  achieve  but  little,  and  we  shall  be  gaining  the  confidence  even  of  those  who  have  chosen  to  number  the  Polish  emigration  among  the  rankest  revolutionists  and  firebrands  of  Europe.  In  saying  this  let  me  not  be  misunderstood  as  wishing  to  cast  any  blame  upon  those  peoples,  who,  having  in  vain  exhausted  all  other  means  to  secure  their  rights,  trampled  upon  by  foreign  despots,  have  atlength  had  recourse  to  arms  to  free  themselves  from  the  hated  yoke.  To  number  ourselves  among  such  has  ever  been  our  greatest  glory  ;  but  I  do  deeply  deplore  that,  owing  to  the  aberrations  of  a  few  members  of  the  emi- gration, the  name  of  the  Poles  should  have  become,  in  the  minds  of  so  grew  a  number  of  persons,  identified  with  the  cause  of  those  visionary  politicians  of  all  na- tions, who  would  subvert  all  existing  governments  and  overthrow  all  established  institutions  in  order  to  create  a  new  world  out  of  the  chaos  ;  and  it  i  3  because  I  think  that  irreparable  injury  is  done  to  our  cause  by  allowing  such  impressions  to  gain  ground  that  I  have  taken  the  liberty  of  addressing  you  on  the  subject,  and  that  I  would  implore  all  of  you  who  think  with  me  to  seize  every  opportunity  for  proving  that  not  only  is  the  restoration  of  Poland  an  event  necessary  in  the  conservative  in- terests of  Europe,  but  that  the  Poles  also  deserve  to  be  numbered  am  eng  the  conservative  and  progressive  nations  of  Europe,  inasmuch  as  they  wish  nothing  more  than  to  be  put  in  possession  of  their  country,  and  quietly  to  develope  its  resources  and  capabilities  according  to  the  laws  which  nature  and  history  may  have  pointed  out  as  the  most  appropriate.  It  is  by  acting  in  accordance  with  such  principles  that  we  shall  be  most  effectually  aiding  the  cause  of  political  liberty  throughout  Europe,  and  help- ing to  promote  the  liberation  of  the  other  nations,  who  are  sighing  under  a  yoke  similar  to  that  which  weighs  upon  Poland  ;  for  nothing  has  contributed  more  to  rivet  the  chains  of  these  nations  than  the  wild  schemes  with  which  their  names  have  been  associated.  The  eyes  of  the  Western  Governments  of  Europe  have  at  length  been  opened  to  the  fact  that  R  uss  i  a  is  the  great  revo  l  u  ti  on  i  st  of  Europe  ;  and,  this  truth  being  once  recognised,  it  will  not  fail  to  work  out  its  consequences,  which  must  plead  advantageous  to  all  oppressednatemonusn,trayndt,ofinitasilyfo,rlmeaedr  to  the  restoration  of  our  beloved  independence.

The  Times  gives  the  following  u  a  translation  of  a  general  oi4er  issued  by  General  Canrobert  upon  the  receipt  of  the  Queen's  I)eepatch  upon  the  con- duct of  the  French  troops  at  the  battle  of  hiker- mann :  GENEHLL  °RIAU.  The  Commander-in-Chief  is  happy  to  have  to  communi- cate to  the  troops  the  expressions,  moist  honourable  for  our  arms,  in  which  her  Majesty  the  Quern  of  England  appro.  elates  their  conduct  at  the  battle  of  lokermanr.  The  Queen  has  remarked  with  grateful  eatiarattiot  the  vigour  with  which  the  troops  of  her  ally,  the  Emperor  of  the  French,  came  to  the  assistance  of  the  divisions  of  the  English  army  engaged  in  so  unequal  a  combat.  Her  Ma- jesty is  profoundly  erosible  ,  of  the  cordial  co-operation  of  the  Commander-in-Chief,  General  Canrobert,  and  of  the  valiant  conduct  of  that  distinguished  officer,  Gen.  Bosquet.

In  marching  to  the  aid  of  our  brave  allies  we  fulfilled  a  duty  which  they  themselves  would  fulfil  towards  us  with  that  valour  we  know  they  possess,  and  so  many  proofs  of  which  wit  have  witnesse  d  with  our  own  eyes.

As  far  hack  as  the  year  1816,  the  Senate  of  Hamburg  published  a  de- wee forbidding  the  enlisting  of  soldiers  on  Ham- burg territory  for  any  foreign  government,  under  heavy  pains  and  penalties.  It  is  probably  in  con- sequence of  the  false  reports  circulated  in  the  Ger- man papers  that  the  Senate  have  thought  proper  to  publish  in  their  official  gazette.  the  Hamburg  Carre-  Cart,  a  renewal  of  the  prohibition,  which  settles  u  f  ee  l4  tion.

The  essential  object  of  this  treatise  is  to  point  out  the  fearful  con- ,equences resulting  from  certain  habits,  irregularities,  and  excesses,  vhich  have  proauced  more  misery  in  Youth,  degradation  in  Man- mod, and  premature  decay  at  all  stages  of  Life,  than,  perhaps,  any  Other  class  of  disease  known  to  modern  pathologists,  Its  perusal  is  .  tarticularly  recommended  to  persons  entertaining  secret  doubts  of  their  physical  condition,  and  who  are  conscious  of  having  hazarded  tne  health,  happiness,  and  privileges:to  which  every  human  being  is  e  ',titled.  It  is  absolutely  necessary  thatall  men  should  know,  that  there  are  •rinciples  of  personal  management  which  cannot  be  violated  without  incurring  grievous  penalties,  and  when  wisdom  and  regret  succeed  the  heyday  of  inconsiderate  self-indulgence,  how  these  penalties  nay  be  mitigated,  how  the  sting  or  heir  bitterness  may  be  removed,  trod  how  the  evil  and  its  consequences  may  be  avoided,  and  above  all,  hat  there  I  .s  scarcely  any  degree  of  physical  infirmity  or  functional  terangement  to  which  the  timely  aid  of  science  cannot  apply  a  cure.  'heAnthor  has  for  a  series  of  years  been  engaged  in  an  extensive  iractice  in  the  treatment  of  these  delicate  complaints,  which  have  nifortunately  been  too  generally  confided  to  the  care  of  ignorant  empirics,  who  inflict  great  injury  on  those  wh  are  induced  to  place  faith  in  their  pretensions.

Both  parties  were  needle  manufactu- rers, carrying  on  business  at  Redditch,  Worcestershire,  and  the  real  defendant,  Mrs.  Gardner,  who,  previous  to  her  marriage,  was  a  Miss  Hoiyoake,  supposing  that  she  had  a  right  to  use  her  maiden  name  of  Holyoake,  had  sold  the  needles  under  that  name,  and  with  similar  labels  to  these  used  by  her  father.  MEETING  OF  THE  BRITISH  RESIDENTS  IN  PARIS.  The  Court  refused  to  grant  the  injunction,  but  gave  the  plaintiff  liberty  to  bring  such  action  as  he  might  be  advised.  A  numerous  meeting  of  the  British  residents  in  ARMY  BEFORE  SEBASTOPOL  COM- MITTEE.—(THis DAY.)  The  committee  reassembled  this  morning  at  the  usual  hour.  Sir  Thomas  Hastings  was  recalled,  and  his  examination  was  resumed  by  Lord  Seymour.  He  in  the  first  instance  stated  that  he  was  not  pre- pared to  say  whether  the  requisitions  sent  to  the  Ord- nance in  June  last  for  a  supply  of  warm  clothing,  to  be  sent  out  to  the  East,  were  made  verbally  or  in  writing.  Communications  of  that  description  from  the  War-office  were  frequently  made  verbally.  When  the  Duke  of  Newcastle  was  in  office,  all  orders  were  covered  by  a  general  sanction.  In  reply  to  Mr.  Layard,  the  witness  stated  that  he  did  not  know  whether  there  was  any  record  of  the  in- structions in  his  office,  but  there  certainly  was  the  record  of  the  execution  of  these  orders.  By  General  Peel—When  he  did  receive  a  written  order  for  the  warm  clothing,  he  acted  upon  it  without  delay,  as  he  was  fully  alive  to  its  importance.  By  the  Chairman--When  a  requisition  of  that  sort  was  sent  to  you,  do  you  think  it  ought  to  depend  upon  your  memory  when  you  are  asked  about  its  execution  ?  The  witness  replied  that  the  record  of  it  if  sent  would  not  be  in  his  office  but  in  the  office  of  the  Secretary  at  War.  The  Chairman—l  suppose,  therefore,  if  we  sent  there  for  it  we  can  have  it  ?  Witness—Undoubtedly.  Examination  contiaued—When  this  requisition  ar- rived he  (witness)  was  in  the  country,  but  he  was  sent  for,  as  the  authorities  at  home  said  they  were  getting  into  a  state  of  perplexity  relative  to  the  warm  clothing.  There  was  a  difficulty  about  enforcing  a  contract—but  he  informed  the  Board  that  it  had  been  entered  as  a  minute  of  the  Board,  and  that  it  ought  not  to  be  quashed  or  rescinded.  He  did  not  inquire  into  the  cause  of  this  because  it  might  have  given  rise  to  an  unpleasant  feeling.  Lurd  Seymour—We  are  not  inquiring  into  questions  of  unpleasant  feeling.  We  wish  to  get  at  the  manner  in  which  business  was  transacted  at  the  Board  of  Ord- nance. Did  you  inquire  why  the  contract  was  to  be  quashed  ?  Witness—No.  The  Chairman—Why  did  you  not  Witness—All  I  thought  of  was  to  carry  out  the  con- ;met, and  to  insure  a  speedy  and  proper  supply.  Lord  Seymour—l  wish  to  ascertain  whether  or  not  the  contractor  had  received  orders  to  stop  the  supply  ?  Witness—l  believe  he  had.  Lord  Seymour—Did  he  tell  you  so  ?  Witness—No,  he  did  not  inform  me  himself  ;  but  I  inferred  that  he  had  bad  orders  to  stop  the  supply  from  what  Mr.  Stacey,  the  storekeeper,  told  me.  He  told  me  that  the  contract  was  stopped.  Lord  Seymour—Did  he  tell  you  on  what  grounds.  Witness—He  did  not.  Lord  Seymour—By  whose  order  then  was  the  contract  stopped  ?  Witness—l  cannot  tell.  The  Chairman—Do  you  not,  then,  see  what  takes  place,  or  have  you  to  depend  merely  upon  hearsay  ?  Witness-  -Generaily  I  do  not  see  what  occurs  under  the  Board.  The  contract  might  have  been  stopped  by  Mr.  Monsell,  or  by  the  united  order  of  the  Board.  General  Peel  here  suggested  that  there  were  surely  minutes  kept  of  the  proceedings  of  the  Board,  to  which  the  witness  might  have  had  access.  The  Chairman—Do  I  understand  that  you  were  not  allowed  to  see  the  minutes  ?  Witness—  Oh,  no  !  When  any  of  us  leave  town  the  minutes  of  the  board  are  not  forwarded  to  us.  The  Chairman—But  when  you  came  back  you  might  have  seen  them  ?  Witness  —Certainly,  but  I  did  not.  I  was  satisfied  with  what  Mr.  Stacey  told  me.  I  had  no  official  infor- mation of  the  fact.  _  .  Mr.  Layard—But  minutes  are  usually  kept  of  all  orders,  are  they  not  ?  Witness—Minutes  until  lately  were  kept  regularly  of  all  proceedings  of  the  board  ;  but  I  will  not  undertake  to  say  there  is  a  minute  relative  to  the  matter  now  be- fore the  committee.  It  being  the  duty  of  the  clerk  of  the  Ordnance  to  communicate  with  the  Secretary  for  War,  and  he  was  in  the  habit  of  bringing  verbal  orders  from  the  War-office,  which  were  at  once  acted  upon—a  course  which  was  never  used  antecedent  to  that  time.  These  orders  were  binding  on  the  Ordnance  although  sent  by  word  of  mouth.  I  was  there,  and  am  still  of  opinion  that  public  business  of  that  kind  should  always  be  re  corded  in  writing  ;  and  although  the  ♦erbal  order  of  the  Secretary  for  War  wat  binding  on  the  board  at  the  same  time,  I  thought  it  was  ,important  and  essential  that  a  written  order  ought  always  to  be  given,  with  a  view  to  its  being  properly  recorded,  and  in  case  any  question  should  arise,  that  the  original  order  should  be  there  to  verify  the  execution  of  its  directions  by  the  board.  In  reply  to  General  Peel,  the  witness  stated  that,  under  a  Secretary  at  War  no  order  of  that  sort  could  have  been  taken  except  through  his  positive  directions.  lie  did  not  think  the  abolition  of  that  office  was  any  improvement.  By  Lord  Seymour—lt  was  probable  that  the  whole  proceedings  connected  with  the  contract  being  irregular,  DO  minute  was  kept.  It  resembled  correspondence  rather  than  an  official  act.  Some  further  conversation  ensued  respecting  the  de- tails of  management  at  the  Ordnance•ofhce,  and  the  quantities  of  warm  clothing  ordered  last  summer,  after  which,  The  Chairman  said—l  have  heard  it  stated  that  at  tLe  hospital  at  Scutari  socks  of  a  size  for  children  were  issued  to  the  men.  Would  that  be  possible,  accord- ing to  your  mode  of  conducting  business  ?  Witness—lf  we  had  proceeded  as  we  do  in  ordinary  times,  that  would  haw°  been  impossible  ;  but  in  thin  case  there  was  great  hurry  ..nd  confusion.  The  Chairman—Do  you  think  it  possible  that  it  occurred?  Witness—lt  is  possible,  but  Ido  not  think  it  is  probable.  The  Chairman—Did  you  never  hear  of  such  an  occur-  rence  ?  Witness—l  heard  that  the  socks  were  not  of  a  full  size.  (Laughter.)  Mr.  Layard—Did  you  ever  hear  also  that  the  shoes  issued  to  the  men  were  not  of  the  full  size  ?  Witness—l  think  that  is  very  possible.  Examination  continued—On  the  7th  August  he  ap- plied to  the  Admiralty  for  tonnage  fo  r  a  l  arge  quantity  of  warm  clothing.  They  did  not  reply  immediately,  as  it  is  not  the  custom  to  reply  until  they  had  tonnage  at  their  disposal.  They  had  no  tonnage  at  disposal  until  the  16th  October.  The  Chairman—And  you  remained  quiet  all  that  time  Witness—l  made  no  less  than  nine  applications,  [LEFT  SITTING.]  OXFORD,  May  2.—By  the  death  of  Sir  Henry  Bishop,  .Duc.  M  as.,  the  Professorship  of  Music  in  the  University,  founded  by  Dr.  Heather,  has  become  vacant.  Sir  Henry  was  appointed  in  1848,  on  the  death  of  Dr.  Crotch.  The  appointment  is  vested  in  the  proctors.  The  price  of  wheat  in  England  during  the  first  quar- ter of  the  present  year  has  been  more  than  50  per  cent.  higher  than  it  was  in  the  quarter  of  1853  that  ended  on  the  31st  March,  but  Os.  7d.  per  quarter  lower  than  it  was  ,  in  the  beginning  of  1854.  Beef  is  25  per  cent.  dearer  than  it  was  in  1853,  and  7  per  cent.  dearer  than  it  was  in  1854.  Mutton  has  been  cheaper  than  it  was  in  1863,  and  so  have  been  potateee.  Paris  and  its  neighbourhood  was  held  yesterday  at  the  English  Embassy  for  the  purpose  of  voting  an  address  of  congratulation  to  the  Emperor  and  Empress  on  the  escape  of  the  former  from  the  hand  of  the  assassin  Pianori.  Lord  Denbigh  presided.  The  proceedings  opened  about  three  o'clock,  when  the  Chairman  rose  and  spoke  as  follows  :  Gentlemen,—My  own  heart  tells  me  that  it  would  be  an  insult  to  any  assembly  of  Eng- lishmen to  suppose  it  possible  that  any  per- suasion could  be  requisite  to  elicit  an  unani- mous expression  of  the  utmost  abhorrence  of  a  dastardly  attempt  to  assassinate  even  the  humblest  individual  in  this  or  any  other  country.  Can  it  therefore  be  necesssary  for  me,  at  such  a  meeting  as  this,  and  on  such  an  occasion  as  the  present,  to  endeavour  to  excite  feelings  which,  judging  from  my  own,  I  am  sure  must  burn  in  every  breast—- feelings in  the  first  place  of  deepest  gratitude  to- wards a  beneficent  Providence  and  the  Almighty  Disposer  of  all  things,  for  having  so  mercifully  pre- served a  life  of  priceless  value—feelings  of  deepest  indignation  at  the  atrocious  act  which  has  im- perilled it,  and  feelings  of  congratulation  towards  the  whole  of  civilised  Europe,  but  more  espe- cially towards  this  great  country  and  our  own,  at  the  preservation  of  a  life  the  value  of  which  no  estimate  can  measure  and  no  language  adequately  express.  Need  I  remind  those  now  enjoying  the  hospitality  of  this  magnificent  city,  so  embellished  by  the  taste  and  munificence  of  the  Emperor,  and  who  are  dwelling  in  security  in  this  happy  and  prosperous  country,  how  lately  it  has  been  raised,  by  the  Emperor's  energy  and  wisdom,  from  a  state  of  almost  hopeless  anarchy,  misery,  and  danger,  to  its  present  high  pitch  of  prosperity  and  happi- ness? Need  I  remind  Englishmen,  who  have  so  lately  witnessed  the  unparalleled  enthusiasm  evinced  by  all  parties  and  all  classes  in  England  towards  their  Imperial  Majesties,  what  the  Emperor  has  effected  in  extinguishing,  I  for  ever—- that hereditary  enmity  between  France  and  Eng- land, hitherto  supposed  to  be  inextinguishable  How  he  has  converted  a  heretofore  mere  conven- tional alliance  between  the  two  countries  into  a  hearty  brotherhood—an  affectionate  union  hence- forth to  be  deemed  indissoluble,  as  being  cemented  by  the  best  blood  of  England  and  France,  shed  by  our  brave  armies,  fighting  side  by  side  in  the  cause  of  justice,  freedom,  and  civilisation  ?  Need  I  enlarge  on  the  fatal  blow  which  would  have  been  struck  at  that  sacred  banner  had  the  assassin  succeeded  in  his  distardly  attempt  ?  But  we  may  join  the  Em- peror in  his  recent  noble  reply  to  the  French  Se- nate, and  assure  him  that  we,  in  unison  with  his  own  chivalrous  feeling,  fear  no  assassin  while  en- gaged as  lie  is,  heart  and  soul,  in  accomplishing  the  glorious  mission  committed  to  him  by  Divine  Pro- vidence. He  has  nobly  fulfilled  the  one  part  in  restoring  the  great  country  to  her  present  exalted  station  of  world-wide  glory  and  power,  as  well  as  of  internal  peace  and  prospe- rity, and  can  any  one  doubt  that  he  will,  through  God's  help,  fulfil  the  other  part,  and  that  so  righteous  a  cause  as  that  of  establishing  an  hon- ourable and  permanent  peace  throughout  Europe  must  and  will  continually  triumph  ?  After  con- gratulating ourselves  that  this  attrocious  at- tempt did  not  happen,  as  might  have  been  the  case,  in  England,  we  may  likewise  con- gratulate our  French  brethren  that  it  was  no  Frenchman  who  raised  his  cowardly  band  against  so  precious  a  life.  Dear,  however,  as  that  life  is  to  England  and  France,  and  precious  as  it  is  to  the  whole  of  the  civilized  world,  we  must  not  forget  that  there  is  one  illustrious  person- age to  whom,  above  all  others,  it  is  immeasurably  dear—even  still  more  precious—and,  however,  feeble  any  language  of  ours  may  be  to  convey  to  the  Empress  any  adequate  expression  of  our  deep  sympathy  and  sincere  congratulation,  we  may  hope  that  her  Imperial  Majesty  will  graciously  accept  an  assurance  of  these  coming  from  the  heart,as  I  am  sure  that  ours  will  do.  There  is  one  other  topic  of  con- gratulation as  respects  ourselves,  to  which  I  will  briefly  refer,  and  that  is,  that  out  of  the  many  millions  whose  feelings  doubtless  respond  to  ours  on  this  occasion,  we  English  residents  in  Paris  are  alone  graciously  permitted  to  enjoy  the  highly  gra- tifying privilege  of  expressing  to  their  Imperial  Majesties  those  sentiments  of  veneration,  sym- pathy, and  congratulation  which  will  be  embodied  in  the  address  now  about  to  be  moved  for  your  adoption,  and  which,  I  trust,  will  receive  your  unanimous  The  Earl  of  Donoughmore  said  that,  after  the  very  able  address  which  had  just  been  delivered  by  the  noble  chairman,  it  was  unnecessary  f  or  hi  m  to  expatiate  on  the  object  for  which  the  meeting  had  been  called.  He  was  perfectly  convinced  that  there  was  not  an  English  heart  here,  or  in  any  part  of  Europe,  that  did  no  t  f  ee  l  t  h  e  d  eepest  indignation  at  the  base  and  dastardly  attempt  that  had  been  made  on  the  Emp  eror  N  apo  l  eon  '  s  lif  e,  an  d  which,  had  it  succeeded,  would  have  ruined  the  cause  for  which  the  French  an  d  E  ng  li  s  h  troops  are  fighting  so  gloriously  side  by  side.  (Loud  cheers.)  It  had  indeed  been  whispered  about  previously  to  the  departure  of  the  Emperor  for  England  that  from  the  number  of  discontent  e  d  re  f  ugees  collected  in  England  from  every  country,  the  visit  was  not  a  safe  one,  and  some  cowardly  attempt  on  his  life  might  be  apprehended,  and  disgrace  thereby  be  thrown  on  England.  He  thanked  Almighty  God  that  such  fears  hack  proved  unfounded,  and  that  the  Emperor  had  returned  in  safety  from  the  Eng- lish soil.  It  was  also  a  source  of  great  satisfaction  that  the  late  base  attempt  at  assassination  had  not  been  made  b  .  y  a  Frenchman--(hear,  hear)—a  n  d  the  brave  allies  of  the  English  were  no  t  sta  i  ned  with  the  reprobation  attached  to  such  an  act.  (Cheers.)  He  would  not  dwell  longer  on  the  subject,  but  express  what  he  felt  certain  was  the  un  an  i  mous  feeling  of  the  meeting,  his  heartfelt  gratitude  to  Providence  for  having  stretched  his  shield  before  the  Emperor,  and  preserved  a  life  of  such  infinite  value,  not  only  to  France,  but  to  all  Europe.  (Cheers.)  I  now  most  heartily  move  that  the  able  address  drawn  up  by  Sir  Henry  Ellis  be  adopted.  (Hear.)

ADDRESS  TO  THE  EMPEROR  OE  THE  FRENCH.  —At  a  Court  of  Aldermen,  held  yesterday,  Alderman  Sidney  proposed  a  resolution  indicative  of  the  profound  sorrow  with  which  the  Court  had  heard  of  the  recent  attempt  to  assassinate  the  Emperor  of  the  French  ,  and  tendering  to  his  Majesty  and  the  Empress  an  expression  of  grati- tude to  Providence  for  having  frustrated  the  diabolical  design,  and  preserved  Fra  nce  and  Europe  from  anarchy.  Mr.  Sidney,  in  making  the  proposition,  expressed  his  admiration  of  the  heroic  and  manly  bearing  Mr  of  he  Alder  dis- tinguished monarch  in  the  hour  of  dang  a  er.  .t  '-  mn  Farebrother,  who  seconded  the  proposal  mi  ,  said  he  agreed  with  Aldermen  Sidney  in  his  ad  ration  of  the  con  duct  of  the  Emperor  when  the  late  atrocious  attempt  ;.made  upon  his  life.  The  proposal  was  unanimously  agr  eed  to,  and  it  was  determined  that  the  resolution  should  be  presented  to  the  French  Ambassador  by  the  Lord  Mayor  and  the  mOver  and  secoAder,  as  a  deputa.  tion  from  the  Court  of  Aldermen.

If  the  Manchester  soirée  of  last  Friday  evening  was  intended  to  be  a  demonstration  iii  favour  of  what  are  called  ,peace  principles,  it  was  a  signal  failure.  The  senior  member  for  Manchester  himself  hung  fire.  He  explicitly  declared  that  the  world  is  now  consti- tuted war  may  be  And  even  with  regard  to  the  war  in  which  we  are  at  present  engaged,  Mr.  Milner  Gibson  confessed  that  he  does  not  see  his  way  clearly.  with  regard  to  the  he  honourable  friend  of  mine  said  to  me,  We  know—we  have  heard  your  hunourable  colleague  on  the  war,  and  we  know  what  are  the  views  of  the  honourable  member  for  the  West  Riding;  but  where  are  you  ?  We  should  like  to  know  where  you  are  on  this  question.'  Well,  sir,  there  is  such  a  thing  as  a  man  not  knowing  exactly  where  he  is.  I  know  that  is  the  case  at  sea  sometimes,  with  ships  under  the  command  of  skilful  navigat  )rs,  in  thick  and  foggy  weather.  When  they  have  not  had  an  observation  for  some  time  they  have  a  very  vague  idea  as  to  their  actual  Mr.  Milner  Gibson,  accord- ing to  his  own  account  of  the  matter,  is  exactly  in  the  same  condition  as  Punch,  in  the  puppet-show  of  the  Deluge,  when  he  halloos  out,  hazy  weather  this,  Mister  And  the  company  addressed  by  Mr.  M.  Gibson  appear  to  have  been  quite  conscious  that,like  him,  they  were,  in  so  far  as  the  war  was  concerned,  at  sea  in  a  fog.  They  received  his  confession  with  a  tolerant  and  approving  laugh,  and  they  wound  ti:s  the  proceedings  of  the  evening  by  voting  thanks  to  the  members  for  the  City  fur  their  honest  and  eloquent  advocacy,  on  all  occasions,  •  of  the  great  principles  to  represent  which  they  wore  returned  to  the  House  of  Not  a  .  word  'of  the  war—a  question  which  had  not  been  mooted  at  the  time  of  the  last  election.  The  Manchester  soirée  is  a  more  effectual  rebuke  to  Messrs.  Bright  and  Cobden,  for  the  course  they  have  of  late  been  pursuing,  than  even  the  meeting  at  Leeds.  At  Manchester,  if  anywhere,  these  gentlemen  were  likely  to  be  surrounded  by  a  host  of  entirely  sympathetic  and  approving  friends.  Yet  even  in  Manchester  they  have  been  unable  to  get  up  a  demonstration  in  favour  of  their  anti-war  policy.  The  members  for  Manchester  have  not  met  their  constituents  to  render  an  account  of  their  stewardship  and  ask  the  electors  to  declare  whether  they  were  satisfied  or  not  with  the  manner  in  which  its  duties  had  been  discharged  They  met  a  number  of  personal  friends  at  a  soirée  held  in  their  honour,  where  any  language  but  that  of  laudation  would  have  been  impertinent  and  out  of  place.  As  an  inducement  to  their  friends  to  rally  round  them,  it  was  urged  that  the  strong  feeling  of  disapprobation  so  prevalent  in  Manchester,  with  referencce  to  the  language  held  by  Mr.  Bright  about  the  war,  was  an  insidious  at- tempt of  the  Tories  to  divide  the  Liberal  interest.  A.  fear  of  breaking  up  the  Liberal  party,  and  a  kindly  feel- ing toward  the  members  and  Mr.  Cobden  (associated  with  them  in  the  honours  of  the  evening),  were  the  mo- tives that  brought  the  assemblage  of  Friday  evening  together  ;  and,  to  allow  these  motives  full  play,  it  was  found  to  be  necessary  to  leave  the.  war  open  ques- This,  in  a  demonstration  where  .Messrs.

THIS  EVENING,  and  every  evening  ,  during  the  week,  the  GRAND  ELEUSINIAN  SPECTACLE  of  MAGIC  and  MYSTERY,  by  Professor  ANDERSON,  the  Great  Wizard  of  the  North,  in  12  acts,  with  ever-changing  variety  of  incidents,  continuous  surprises,  novel  and  extraordinary  effects.  Magic  and  Mystery  is  an  entirely  new  entertainment,  pos- sessing distinctive  characteristics  and  peculiar  phases  of  amusement.  It  is  Rot  a  monologue,  for  the  audience  them•  selves  perform  their  parts  with  the  principal  actor,  some  of  them  on  the  stage  and  others  in  front  ;  it  is  not  an  exhibition,  for  though  everything  becomes  metamorphosed  before  the  eyes  of  the  visitors  zo  one  can  be  positive  that  he  sees  any  one  thing;  but  it  is  a  comedy  really  performed  by  the  corn•  pant;  a  melodrama  replete  with  startling  positions  and  unex- pected denouements  ;  a  magnificent  spectacle,  with  2,000  of  ...21  6  ...2'  3  .22  0  -.22  0  _2O  6  ...21  6  ...21  9  ...21  0  ...20  6  ...21  0  ...21  6  _22  0  ...20  9  ...21  9  ...20  3  ...21  6  ..  21  6  _2O  II  ...22  0  _2O  0  -.18  6  ...1A  6  ...20  6  the  public  every  night  to  appear  as  auxiliaries  ;  and  an  es•  travaganza,  in  which  all  that  seems  to  be  is  entirely  beyond  the  bounds  of  probability.  Professor  Anderson  returns  his  thanks  to  thronged  awl  fashionable  audiences  which  have  nightly  filled  the  Lyceum  Theatre  to  overflow,  and  by  means  of  whose  generous  aid  he  has  been  enabled  to  announce  Magic  and  Mystery  for  con- tinuous repetition.  He  believes  that  no  professor  of  his  art  bas  at  any  time  •r  in  any  place  been  honoured  with  an  amount  of  success  so  extensive,  se  decided,  and  so  unusual.  He  would  attribute  that  success  to  three  causes  ;  first,  that  in  his  present  entertainment  he  has  placed  before  his  visitors  the  results  of  a  life  sedulously  devoted  to  the  attainment  of  perfected  skill  in  one  peculiar  art,  and  to  perfect  which  he  has  travelled  the  globe  in  every  clime  ;  secondly,  that  he  has  spared  no  trouble  nor  expense  to  put  this  entertainment  on  the  stage  in  the  most  elaborate  manner,  by  the  employment  of  the  first  mechanicians  and  artists  of  the  day  ;  and  thirdly,  that,  while  endeavouring  to  provide  amusement  for  those  who  honour  him  with  their  presence,  he  has  not  forgetten  that  it  is  possible  to  afford  information  also,  and  that  the  oppor- tunity should  not  be  neglected  of  exposing  conjuring  wher- ever it  has  been  used  for  nefarious  purposes,  or  whenever  by  resortieg  to  the  conjurer's  arts,  in  an  illegitimate  manner,  the  designing  have  succeeded  in  making  dupes  of  th  ►ee,  14  credulous.  'ost  office  When  due  in  t  land.  The  937  letters  on  the  subject  of  spirit-rapping,  which  Pr  fessor  Anderson  has  received,  from  the  time  of  opening  th  theatre  up  to  the  present  date,  bear  witness  to  the  great  int  terest  taken  on  the  subject  of  this  singular  delusion  ;  whilst  many  of  them  bear  melancholy  evidence  to  the  dangers  which  attend  a  belief  in  the  superstitious  nonsense  of  the  Spiri  t  Judging  simply  by  the  correspondence  which  has  resulted,  Professor  Anderson's  exposé  of  spirit-rapping  and  his  illustration  of  the  so-called  table  phenomena,  have  pro:  duced  a  sensation  unequalled  by  any  previous  attempt  to  exs  pose  a  mischievous  and  impudent  juggle.  It  is  impossible  for  Professor  Anderson  to  reply  at  length  to  a  tithe  of  the  communications  which  reach  him  on  the  subject.  He  regrets  that  many  of  these  should  come  from  ladies  and  gentlemen  who,  from  their  position  in  society  and  their  well-known  in'-  tellectital  attainments,  he  would  least  have  expected  to  have  been  converts  to  a  belief  so  preposterous  in  itself,  and  se  .  easily  susceptible  of  being  controverted  and  disproved.  Evert  evening,  from  the  Lyceum  stage,  Mr.  Anderson's  opinions  or  spirit-rapping  are  expressed,  and  every  evening,  within  the  Lyceum,  how  tables  can  be  made  to  rap  is  exhibited  and  elucidated.  It  is  respectfully  requested  that  this  public  exposition  will  be  accepted  generally  as  Professor  Anderson's  only  mode  of  replying  at  full  length  to  his  multitudinous  correspondents.  He  regrets  that  the  names  of  the  great  and  learned  of  the  land  should  •  have  been  made  to  figure  in  the  documents  emanating  from  the  spirit-rappers,  as  for  instance  the  following,  ex- tracted from  the  Morning  Advertiser  of  Thursday,  Septem- , ber  20,  and  taken  by  that  journal  from  the  New  York  Spiri- tual Telegraph.  It  purports  to  emanate  from  an  American  spirit-rapper,  Mr.  D.  D.  Hume  Sir  David  Brewster  frankly  confesses  that  he  is  sorely  puzzled'  at  what  ho  has  witnessed,  and  Lord  Brougham  acknowledges  himself  to  be  thoroughly  nonplussed.  Both  of  these  noted  men  brought  the  whole  force  of  their  keen  discernment  to  bear  upon  the  solution  of  the  phenomena;  but  the  presence  of  substantial,  actual  hands,  and  the  demonstrative  strength  of  the  spirits  who  thus  clothed  themselves  for  the  time,  and  moved  mate- rial objects  about  tho  room,  proved  to  be  too  much  of  a  ques- tion for  them  to  Mr.  D.  D.  Hume,  the  author  of  the  above,  has  recently  left  England,  and  the  following  account  df  who,  and  what  he  is,  occurs  in  the  Family  Herald,  No.  648:  This  young  man,  who  is  a  Scotchman  by  birth,  and  now  in  Italy,  is  a  remarkable  medium  for  all  the  manifestations  without  apparatus.  Barnum,  who  is  well-known  throughout  -  the  Anglo-Saxon  world  as  a  splendid  humbug,  offered  him  2.000  dollars  per  annum  if  he  would  perform  at  his  museum  in  New  York.  Barnum  then  took  it  for  granted  that  mediums  could  be  bought.  He  was  somewhat  astonished  when  his  offer  was  '  refused.  Hume,  on  telling  the  fact  in  London  lately,  simply  and  honestly  renaarkcel,  that  the  money  would  have  been  very  acceptable  to  him,  for  he  was  poor,  young  (under  24),  an  or- phan, and  in  very  had  health  :  but  he  would  have  been  afraid  of  losing  his  power  as  a  medium,  and  ho  would  sooner  lose  his  life.  The  refusal,  however,  made  Barnum  thoughtful.  Be  inquired  into  the  subject;  and  now  Barnum,  one  of  the  greatest  humbugs  in  the  world,  and  withal  a  conjuror,  ie  one  of  the  firrnast  believers  in  It  is  cer- tainly surprising  to  find  such  a  paragraph  as  this  in  the  editorial  article  of  an  established  journal,  the  editor  of  whoni  might  be  supposed  to  be  sane.  Even  if  Barnum  does  believe  in  spirit-rapping--does  spirit-rapping  gain  or  lose  by  this  accession  to  its  adherents?  and,  with  Barnum's  endorse  ment  to  it,  is  this  bill,  drawn  on  public  credulity,  more  likely  to  be  negotiated  Professor  Anderson  would  believe  not  ;  but,  when  he  finds  that  educated  clergymen  of  the  Church  of  England  have  the  temerity  to  subscribe  their  names  to  so  gross  a  swindle,  when  he  finds  that  the  Incumbent  of  Wortley  (the  Rev.  N.  J.  Godfrey)  positively  asserts  his  belief  in  it,  and  writes  a  book  on  the  subject,  he  considers  it  t'  be  time  for  him  to  state  that  which  he  knows  of  the  mechanism  by  which  it  is  effected,  and  the  mischief  to  which  it  tends.  In  the  Morning  Advertiser  of  October  3  appears  a  letter  from  Sir  David  Brewster,  relative  to  that  which  he  saw  at  Cox's  Hotel,  in  company  with  Lord  Brougham.  He  distinctly  states  that  which  the  Wizard  of  the  North  proclaims  every  night—that  spirit-rapping  is  nothing  more  than  conjuring  applied  to  bad  purposes.  In  the  Morning  Advertiser  of  the  following  day,  however,  there  is  an  answer  to  Sir  David's  letter  from  one  who  was  present  when  he  and  Lord  Brougham  had  their  séance  with  the  spirits,  in  which  the  writer  says,  that  the  table  (a  large  dinner-table,  I  believe)  moved  about  in  the  most  extraordinary  manner,  and,  among  other  things,  a  large  ac- cordion was  conveyed  by  an  invisible  agency  to  my  hand  and  then  to  Lord  Brougham's,  in  which,  held  by  his  lordship's  right  hand,  apart  from  any  person,  it  played  an  air  through- With  such  a  statement,  printed  for  the  edification  of  .  the  people  of  the  19th  century,  with  the  facts  before  us  that  .  the  most  talented  men  of  the  day  aro  permitting  themselves  to  be  deluded  by  these  juggling  spirit-mongers—that  the  greatest  novelist  of  the  age  is  now  engaged  in  making  it  the  subject  of  a  new  work,  and  that  a  spiritual  has  actually  been  advertised  to  be  held  in  St.  Martin's-hall,  Professor  Anderson  trusts  that  his  exposures  of  the  spiritual- - fists  of  America,  as  given  by  him  nightly  at  the  Lyceum,  will  be  received  by  the  people  of  England  as  genuine  honest  at- tempts to  provide  an  antidote  for  the  bane  of  the  spiritual  ugglere.  In  the  course  of  the  last  five  weeks  100,017  persons  have  visited  the  Lyceum  Theatre,—a  larger  number,  it  is  believed,  .  than  has  ever  before  been  assembled  within  its  walls  in  so  short  a  period.  Magic  and  Mystery  is  repeated  every  even.  ing,  the  programme  being  continually  changed.

Act  2.  The  Aqua-Avial  Paradox;  exemplifying  the  power  of  producing  animated  nature  from  fire  and  water  only,  and  the  possibility  of  eliciting  from  the  simplest  elements  the  most  complex  forms  of  ornithological  existence.  Act  3.  Le  Livre  des  Beeueils  Choisies  :  or,  Puck's  Own  Pocket  Book,  with  Puck  himself  within  it.  Typifying  the  evening's  entertainment  in  the  production  of  the  very  volu- minous from  a  small  volume,  in  the  extraction  of  magnitude  out  of  minuteness,  in  developing  bulk  where  no  space  appears  for  its  existence,  is  discovering  odd  things  in  odd  places,  and  in  bringing  forth  unexpected  wonders  from  the  most  unlikely  place  for  to  be  found.  Act  4.  Magical  Locomotion  ;  or,  Transition  without  Trou- ble. In  which  will  be  comprised—the  Adventures  of  a  Wed- ding Ring,  the  Peregrinations  of  a  Bank  Not.,  the  Transfor- mation—black into  white,  and  the  Discovery  of  every  Article  in  the  position  which  would  seem  the  most  inappropriate.  Act  5.  L'Ecrin  de  Verve;  or,  the  Casket  of  Crcesus.  Into  which,  though  made  entirely  of?  glass  perfectly  transparent,  and  suspended  so  as  to  be  visible  to  the  eyes  of  all  present,  the  Wizard  will  cause  the  money  of  his  visitors  to  transport  itself,  and  rain  into  the  casket,  though  its  lid  be  closed,  locked,  and  the  key  in  the  possession  of  the  audience.  Act  6.  Clairvoyance  Extraordinary  ;  er,  the  Transparency  of  Opacity.  Act.  7.  A.  New  Bottle  of  Bacchus  ;  or,  the  Novel  Wine  and  Spirit  Store.  An  improvement  upon  the  inexhaustible  inasmuch  as  the  Wizard's  bottle  will  net  only  be  in- exhaustible, but  will  change  its  contents,  ad  infinitum,  at  the  word  of  command,  producing  soda-water,  butter-milk,  Epsom  salts,  Port,  Sherry,  brandy,  gin,  rum,  whisky,  *oyeau,  or  any  other  wine  or  spirit  required  ;  and  finally  proving  to  be  felled  with  pocket  handkerchiefs  perfectly  dry,  and  occupying  the  whole  space  when  tightly  packed.  Act  8.  Half  an  Hour  with  the  Spirits  ;  or,  an  Expose  of  fipirit-rapping.  Introducing  the  spirit-rapping  table  and  tocsin  of  the  invisibles.  Act.  9.  Grand  Mystic  Amalgam,  in  which  the  property  of  the  Wizard's  patrons  will  undergo  some  strange  metamor- plisses, and,  amongst  others,  their  handkerchiefs  become  transformed  into  the  flags  of  victory—tke  haw  sers  of  E.  g  l  a  nd,  France,  Turkey,  and  Sardinia.  Act.  10.  The  Enchanted  Chair  of  Comus,  in  which  he  who  seats  himself  will  be  under  the  magic  spell,  and  appear  to  the  audience,  under  circumstances  least  expected,  in  a  posi- tion as  peculiar  as  perplexing.  Act.  11.  The  Mystery  of  the  Charmed  Chest  ;  or,  the  Nucleus  of  the  Night's  Wonders.  To  comprehend  which  the  audience  will  have  the  goodness  to  observe,  in  an  earlier  part  of  the  evening,  the  chest  suspended  (like  Mahommed's  coffin)  in  mid-air,  into  which  all  things  will  travel,  and  out  of  which  all  will  be  produced.  Act.  12.  The  If  o  raological  Evaporation  ;  or,  the  Slic.tast  Route  to  the  Antipodes.  Illustrating  the  easiest  mode  of  ridding  ourselves  of  a  troublesome  friend,  and  the  advantages  of  the  newly-discovered  dia-terrestrial  passage  from  the  west- ern to  the  eastern  hemisphere.

The  deserters  and  prisoners  report  that  the  Russian  line-of-battle  ships  anchored  in  the  roadstead  opposite  Fort  St.  Nicholas  begin  to  suffer  from  the  fire  of  the  mortar  battery  on  the  side  of  the  Quarantine  Bay.  On  the  27th  a  shell  passed  through  the  three  decks  of  the  Tchesmi,  killing  and  wounding  several  men,  and  then  bursting  in  the  hold  set  fire  to  her  for  a  short  time.  Some  days  before  a  projectile,  fired  by  a  French  vessel,  berating  in  a  work- shop near  the  Artillery  Bay,  caused  the  explosion  of  a  number  of  loaded  shells,  killed  several  artillerymen,  and  caused  such  damage  that  the  Russians  have  not  since  dared  to  collect  together  such  a  quantity  of  combustibles  in  one  place.  The  shells  from  the  allied  vessels  occasion  much  damage  to  the  place  and  severe  losses  to  the  garrison.  Their  effects  are  more  feared  than  those  of  the  rockets.  The  number  of  naval  artillerymen  in  the  place  has  been  reduced  from  111,000  to  3,501),  and  there  are  now  only  three  artillerymen  for  each  gun.  The  rations  of  vegetables  and  brandy  have  been  diminished  one-half  on  board  the  Russian  vessels,  and  the  captains  of  them  have  received  orders  to  economise  their  consumption  of  salt  pork  as  much  as  possible.  The  commander-in-chief  has  ordered  the  inhabitants  to  quit  the  town.  The  opinion  that  the  place  must  infallibly  fall  into  the  power  of  the  allied  armies  is  more  and  more  general  among  the  besieged,  and  that  feeling  has  greatly  increased  their  discouragement,  parti•  cularly  during  the  last  few  days.  THE  BALTIC.  The  news  from  the  fleet,  which  reached  Dantzio  yesterday,  announces  that  Admirals  Dundas  Sey- mour, and  Penaud  were  at  Nargen.  Admiral  Baynes,  with  the  rest  of  the  fleet,  was  before  Cronstadt.  On  the  14th  the  Raby  gun-boat,  with  the  boats  of  the  Arrogant  and  Magicienne,  had  a  sharp  affair  at  Wiborg.  One  officer  and  one  man  were  killed,  and  ten  wounded.  According  to  a  correspondence  from  the  northern  parts  of  the  Gulf  of  Bothnia,  inserted  in  the  Aflonbladel,  nu  vessels  of  the  allied  fleets  had  arrived  as  far  nurth  as  the  Umea  by  the  4th  inst.  In  Wasa  there  were  at  that  time  200  to  900  Russian  troops,  and  in  Ny-Carleby  only  twenty  to  thirty  Cossacks.  Gamla-Carleby,  where  they  louk  forward  to  another  visit  from  our  countrymen,  has  a  garrison  of  2,000  men  in  the  town  and  th  4  neighbourhood  ;  earthworks  also  have  been  thrown  up  round  the  town.  All  pilots  that  formerly  had  their  stations  in  the  outer  channel  had  been  compelled  to  take  up  their  abode  in  the  town.  The  fortress  of  Svartholm  and  town  of  Lovisa  were  destroyed  on  the  sth  by  an  English  squadron.  The  latter  was  burnt  by  accident,  it  appears,  although  the  Russian  journals  speak  of  the  occurrence  as  an  act  of  wilful  and  useless  barbarism.  An  authentic  account  of  the  affair  is  transmitted  by  the  following  despatch  Duke  of  Wellington,  Tolboukin  Lighthouse,  July  7.  The  Magicienne  returned  this  morning  from  Lovisa,  and  I  have  received  a  report  from  Captain  Yelverton,  of  her  Majesty's  ship  Arrogant,  who  has  been  again  successful  in  destroying  a  well•constructed  fort  at  Svartholm,  in  the  entrance  of  the  Bay  of  Lovisa;  but  their  lordships  will  observe  with  regret  that,  notwithstanding  the  humane  desire  of  that  officer,  the  town  of  Lovisa  was  unfortu- nately destroyed  bt  fire,  which  occurred  acnitlentally,  on  the  night  following  the  visit  of  her  Majesty's  ships.  Cap•  tam  Vansittan.  informs  me  that  the  authorities  of  the  town  have  themselves  admitted  and  explained  the  accidental  origin  of  the  fire.  SIR  CHARLES  NAPIER  received  a  summons  to  attend  at  court  for  the  purpose  of  being  installed.  He,  however,  declined  the  proffered  boon.  The  United  Service  Gazette  adds  that  the  reason  assigned  by  the  gallant  admiral,  if  not  officially  given,  is  well  known  to  his  friends.  I  have  he  says  censured  and  degraded,  and  have  been  denied  the  opportunity  of  clearing  my  reputation.  Yet  am  I  now  offered  a  Jny  21,  1855.  THE  BALTIC  FLEET.  (From  our  Own  Correspondent.)  OFF  CRONsTADT.  JULY  3.—This  morning  we  heard,  by  the  arrival  of  the  Lightning,  that  the  Magicienne  has  destroyed  twenty.six  vessels  of  the  large  description  of  coasting  traders.  In  all  these  affairs,  the  Russian  troops  Who  are  distributed  along  the  coast  decamp  rapidly,  not  choosing  to  come  within  range  of  grape  anci  canister  from  our  vessels'  broadsides  ;  so  that,  when  there  is  no  landing  indiscreetly  attempted,  we  have  it  our  own  way.  There  is  no  change  in  the  position  otherwise  of  the  squadron  to-day.  JULY  4.—The  Cuckoo  arrived  this  morning  from  the  Gulf  of  Bothnia,  and  reports  that  our  block  ading  squadron  there  have  destroyed  thirty  thousand  tons  of  shipping  of  all  sorts  and  sizes.  The  in- habitants in  the  islands,  and  on  the  mainland  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Uleaborg,  deserted  their  villages  on  our  ships  coming  in  sight,  and  but  little  could  be  procured  in  the  provision  line  at  any  price.  This  is  to  be  accounted  for  by  the  poor  wretches  who,  to  save  themselves  from  absolute  starvation  (which  would  have  been  their  fate,  from  the  coasting  trade  being  stoppod)  sold  their  little  stock  to  provide  for  their  families,  and  who  were  barbarously  punished  for  so  doing  on  the  allied  forces  being  withdrawn  from  the  Baltic.  This  last  affair—viz.,  the  destruc- tion of  their  vessels—must  have  been  a  severe  blow  to  the  inhabitants;  but  it  is  one  of  the  melancholy  effects  of  war,  and  I  fear,  if  looked  on  in  a  right  view,  is  unavoidable.  There  has  been  considerable  correspondence  carried  on  lately  between  the  com  mander.in-chief  of  the  allied  forces  and  the  Minister  of  War  to  the  Emperor  of  all  the  Russias,  principally  regarding  the  Hango  Head  affair,  which  of  course  the  enemy  wishes  to  repudiate.  A  flag  of  truce  has  always  been  hoisted,  and  great  ceremony  been  ob- served, on  the  part  of  the  officers  charged  with  the  correspondence,  as  to  keeping  at  a  respectful  dis- tance from  the  guns  of,  on  our  part  the  batteries  at  Cronstadt,  on  theirs  of  our  ships.  Mucti  good- natured badinage  has  passed  between  the  English  and  Russian  officers,  and  they  appear  to  have  been  very  friendly  in  their  manner.  Two  soldiers,  who  had  been  made  prisoners  at  13otriarsund,  and  ex- changed with  English  prisoners  in  the  East,  were  then  returned  to  their  country.  They  did  not  ap- pear to  relish  the  idea  of  the  change  they  would  experience  in  their  diet  fiom  beef  and  pudding  to  sour  bread  and  oil.  JULY  6.—The  James  Watt  and  her  gun-boat  returned  to-day  from  her  blockading  position  on  the  north  side  of  the  Gulf.  She  has  dispersed  all  the  encampments  of  troops  that  were  collected  along  the  coast,  and  burnt  four  telegraph-stations,  with  no  loss  on  our  side.  On  the  south  the  Royal  George  has  been  employed  in  the  same  manner.  Her  gun- boat got  on  shore  :  one  gun  opened  fire  upon  her,  and  others  were  being  brought  down  at  an  immense  rate  by  horse  artillery,  when  she  fortunately  was  got  off—having  gained  her  object,  which  was  to  destroy  a  large  telegraph.  This  evening  Much  excitement  was  caused  by  all  the  gun-boats  being  ordered  to  prepare  for  immediate  service.  All  the  launches  and  pinnaces  were  armed  with  the  brass  guns,  rockets,  &amp;c.  The  captain  of  the  Duke  of  Wellington  was  ordered  to  take  comtnand.  Every  gun-boat  weighed  immediately  alter  the  signal  was  made,  and,  taking  a  string  of  these  boats  in  tow,  steered  in  to- wards the  barrier  on  the  north  aide.  Everybody  was  in  a  state  of  excitement  and  expectancy—the  Rus- sian gun-boats  began  to  move  abmit—signals  innu- merable were  made  by  the  block-ships  outside  the  harbour—when,  however,  the  gun.  boats,  &amp;c.,  were  within  two  miles  of  the  enemy  they  were  painfully  reminded  that  we  warriors  of  the  Baltic  fleet  are  not  seriously  at  war,  by  the  recal  being  made;  and  back  they  all  came.  JULY  7.—To-day,  at  four  o'clock  in  the  afternoon,  two  Russian  gun-boats,  I  presume  encouraged  by  our  hitherto  pacific  proceedings  up  here,  came  out,  and,  after  dodging  about  for  some  time,  got  into  a  posi- tion which  cer',ainly  endangered  their  being  cut  off  by  our  light  vessels.  Two  of  our  captains  (I  won't  mention  names,  as  opinions  are  diverse  concerning  the  result)  went  on  board  their  gun-boats,  and,  in  spite  of  the  recal  being  hoisted  on  board  the  flag  ship  (the  admiral  was  away,  reconnoitring  on  the  south  side),  they  (our  gun.boats)  went  on  at  full  speed.  At  last,  all  hands  were  certain  that  shots  would  be  exchanged.  The  Russians  moved  but  slowly,  apparently  waiting  for  us.  In  a  quarter  of  an  hour  our  vessels  were  within  shot.  They  turned  their  heads  towards  the  enemy  and  tired.  There  was  a  universal  cheer  throughout  the  fleet,  as  every- thing looked  like  business;  when,  to  our  astonish- ment, we  saw  them  turn  back,  and  steam  at  full  speed  for  the  fleet.  I  shall  make  no  comment.  All  I  hear  are  expressions  of  disappointment  at  the  re- sult. The  Russians  steatned  quietly  into  harbour.  Had  the  lieutenants  of  the  gunboats  disobeyed  THE  PRESS.  openly  the  signal  (which  was  enforced  by  four  guns),  and  then,  having  taken  the  responsibility  on  them- selves, not  given  some  account  of  the  enemy,  they  must  have  been  cashiered.  With  captains  (unfortunately  for  our  service)  it  is  very  different.  The  admirals  have  been  reconnoitring  in  every  direction  lately.  We  hear  that  Admiral  Baynes  (without  his  squadron)  is  coming  here;  so  I  suppose  a  grand  council  will  be  held  as  to  our  future  proceedings.  The  weather  is  most  beautiful,  though  hot,  and  the  crews  of  the  ships  are  all  well,  generally  speaking.  Admiral  Seymour  has  nearly  recovered,  though  he  still  suffers  a  good  deal  from  his  eyes  having  been  affected  by  the  explosion  of  the  infernal  machine.  Apropos  of  machines,  they  are  now  a  dead  letter,  though  there  must  be  plenty  of  them  close  to  us.  I  regret  that  1  cannot  give  you  more  interesting  news.  Indeed,  we  are  all  heartily  nick  of  this  inactivity;  and  many  a  man  would  give  a  quarterly  to  exchange  to  the  Black  Sea  fleet.  Several  experiments  are  being  made  in  the  long  range,  some  of  which  are  very  suc- cessful ;  but  it  is  better  not  to  expose  them  as  yet.  THE  NEW  FRENCH  LOAN.  THE  plan  to  be  adopted  by  the  French  Govern- ment for  raising  the  new  loan  of  30,090,000/.  is  to  be  the  same  as  on  the  last  occasion—by  a  direct  appeal  to  the  nation,  who  will  have  the  option  of  taking  either  the  Four-and-a-Half  per  Cents.  or  the  Three  per  Cents.,  as  follows  :—The  Four  and  a-  Half  per  Cent.  Rente  at  92f.  25c.,  with  interest  from  the  22nd  of  March  last  ;  and  the  Three  per  Cents.  at  65f.  25c.,  with  interest  from  the  22nd  of  June.  The  capital  subscribed  to  be  paid  as  fol- lows :—One-tenth  at  the  time  of  subscribing,  and  the  remainder  in  monthly  instalments,  in  eighteen  equal  parts,  of  which  the  first  shall  be  due  on  the  7th  of  September  next.  These  conditions  will  give  the  subscribers  various  advar  t  ages,  equivalent  to  2f.  79c.  on  the  Four-and  a-Half  per  Cents.,  and  of  If.  98c.  on  the  Three  per  Cents.  Those  who  pay  up  at  once  will  receive  a  discount  equivalent  to  this  profit.  These  combined  advan- tages reduce  the  price  of  the  Four  and-a-Half  per  Cents.  to  891.  46c.,  and  that  of  the  Three  per  Cents.  to  631.  27c.,  and  are  calculated  to  give  to  the  sub  •  scriber  a  profit  of  3f.  29c.  on  the  former,  and  of  21.  C3e.  on  the  latter.  In  case  the  amount  subscribed  should  exceed  the  sum  required,  the  subscriptions  of  501.  of  Rente  and  below  are  alone  to  be  exempt  from  reduction,  and  all  those  above  50?.  to  undergo  a  proportionate  reduction.  As  in  the  former  loans,  the  minimum  of  the  subscription  will  be  fixed  at  101.  of  Rente.  THE  PARIS  EXHIBITION.  TEE  fbreign  commissioners  of  the  Paris  Universal  Exhibition,  at  their  sitting  on  the  10th  inst.,  under  the  presidency  of  Baron  James  de  Rothschild,  unani- mously passed  a  resolution  that  the  Exhibition  is  now  complete,  that  it  is  in  every  respect  worthy  of  the  hopes  which  had  been  conceived  of  it,  and  that  it  presents  interesting  improvements,  the  study  of  which  cannot  be  but  useful  both  to  special  men  and  to  those  who  examine  in  a  general  manner  the  development  and  the  progress  of  the  human  mind.  Special  trains  are  now  being  organised  between  London  and  Paris,  to  take  to  the  Exhibition  the  greatest  number  possible  of  Englishmen  workmen.  It  is  al,o  said  special  trains  will  go  from  Berlin,  Vienna,  and  Frankfort,  to  Paris.  The  Exhibition  is  giving  a  great  impetus  to  trade,  not  only  in  the  French  capital  but  elsewhere;  in  tact,  many  of  the  large  houses  of  France  are  unable  to  complete  the  extensive  orders  which  have  originated  from  the  exposition  of  their  goods  in  the  Palms  de  l'lndustrie.  IN  addition  to  the  honorary  distinctions  bestowed  on  some  of  the  colonels  of  the  regiments  in  the  Crimea,  Lord  Hardinge  has  conferred,  in  several  instances,  the  more  substantial  token  of  a  good- service pension.  Colonels  Cameron  of  the  42nd,  Shirley  of  the  SBth,  Cobbe  of  the  4th,  O'G.  Hely  of  the  47th,  H.  Daubeny  of  the  55th,  Hon.  A.  Spencer  of  the  44th,  and  Lord  G.  Paget  of  the  4th  Dragootis,  have  come  in  for  1001.  each,  as  a  reward  for  dis- tinguished Ax  exclusive  concession  for  a  submarine  telegraph  from  the  Dardanelles  to  Alexandria  has  been  granted  by  the  Turkish  Government.  The  communications  from  India  will  be  accelerat  d  from  five  to  six  days  when  this  and  the  general  system  of  telegraphs  now  constructing  in  European  Turkey  shall  have  been  completed.  Proposals  are  on  foot  for  extending  the  project  to  India  by  carrying  the  communication  via  Suez  and  Aden  to  Kurrachee,  at  the  month  of  the  Indus,  where  it  would  connect  with  the  lines  already  in  operation,  et  in  course  of  construction,  by  the  East  India  Company  throughout  the  various  Presidencies.  The  entire  line  to  India  may,  it  is  estimated,  be  corn  pleted  in  two  years.  THE  probability  that  Lord  Melville,  at  present  Commander  of  the  Forces  in  Scotland,  will  go  out  to  to  the  Crimea  to  take  the  command  of  a  division  is  stated  by  our  contemporary  the  Scotsman.

The  show  of  English  wheat  in  to-day's  market  was  limited,  yet  most  of  Monday's  unsold  samples  were  cleared  off  at  that  day's  currency.  There  was  only  a  trifling  inquiry  for  foreign  wheat,  the  supply  of  which  was  moderate,  yet  holders  generally  were  firm,  and  the  quotations  were  well  supported.  The  barley  trade  was  dull,  yet  we  have  no  change  to  note  in  prices.  Malt  moved  off  heavily,  on  former  terms.

DEATH  OF  COLONEL-  I  3  11110B1).  ____  ,  -  It  is  our  painful  duty  to  announce  the  decease  of  the  well-known  Colonel  Sibthorp,  member  for  Lincoln.  The  name  of  the  gallant  Colonel  has  long  been  a  household  word  as  the  embodiment  of  honest  but  unreasoning  Tory  prejudice  ;  down  to  the  very  last  he  showed  himself  a  politician  of  the  extinct  school  of  Lord  Eldon  and  the  late  Duke  of  Newcastle,  whom  he  thoroughly  revered,  and  consequently,  in  these  days  of  divided  parties  and  allegiance,  he  found  himself  as  frequently  opposed  to  the  great  Conservative  party  as  the  late  Frederick  Lucas  to  his  Liberal  allies.  The  deceased  gentleman  was  de- scended from  an  ancient  family  settled  upwards  of  a  century  and  a  half  at  Canwick.hall,  near  Lincoln,  many  of  whose  membere  from  time  to  time  have  repre- sented that  city  in  Parliament.  His  father,  the  late  Mr.  Humphry  Waldo  Sibthorp,  sat  for  several  years  at  the  commencement  of  the  present  century.  His  son,  Charles  Dalaet  Waldo  Sibthorp,  was  first  elected  in  the  high  Tory  interest  in  1826,  and  with  the  exception  of  the  brief  Parliament  of  1833.4,  chosen  under  the  ex- citement consequent  upon  the  passing  of  the  Reform  Bill,  he  continued  to  represent  Lincoln  to  the  day  of  his  death.  The  Colonel's  iufiuence  was  great  among  the  registered  electors,  upwards  of  1,300  in  number,  consisting  of  free- men resident  and  non-resident  ;  but  it  did  not  extend  so  far  as  to  be  able  often  to  secure  the  second  seat  for  a  Tory  friend,  the  predilections  of  the  constituency  being  rather  personal  towards  himself  than  based  on  any  political  grounds.  Thus,  although  Col.  Sibthorp  could  generally  reckon  on  the  support  of  some  600  voters,  and  in  conse- quence was  usually  returned  at  the  head  of  the  poll,  in  1835  and  1837  he  was  unable  to  prevent  the  then  Radical  Sir  Edward  Lytton  Bulwer  from  being  chosen  as  his  col- league, while  in  1847  Mr.  Charles  Seely  and  i  n  1848  M  r.  Thomas  notihouse  were  elected  against  Tory  candidates,  and  Mr.  G.  F.  Hereage  aecnre  d  the  second  seat  at  the  general  election  in  1852.  Once,  and  once  only,  did  the  gallant  Wooers  good  fortune  fail  him,  and  that  was,  when  a  majority  of  83  dis- e have  said,  in  1833,  i  p  as  laC  v  ed  him  to  make  room  for  Sir  E.  Bulwer.  The  gal- lant Colonel  was  born,  we  believe,  in  1782,  and  in  1813  married  Maria,  daughter  of  the  la  te  Mr.  Ponsonby  Tot- tenham, many  years  M.P.  for  the  borough  of  Fethard,  'n  the  Irish  House  of  Commons,  and  by  whom  h  e  l  eaves  issue  several  children.  His  brother,  the  Rev.  H.  Waldo  Sibthorp,  late  Fellow  of  Magdalen  College,  Oxford,  be- came a  Roman  Catholic  some  few  year,  since,  but  soon  afterwards  returned  to  the  English  Church.  Col.  Sib- thorp was  for  many  years  a  magistrate  and  deputy-lieu- tenant for  the  county  of  Lincoln,  and  i  n  1852  was  ga  netted  to  the  Colonelcy  of  the  South  Lincolnshire  Militia.  H  e  s  trenuously  and  consistently  opp  ose  d  i  n  a  ll  t  h  e  i  r  stages  Catholic  Emancipation,  the  Reform  Bill,  and  the  Aboli-ion  of  the  Jewish  Disabilities,  an  d  was  one  of  the  minority  of  53  who  censured  free  trade  when  Lord  Derby  was  in  office  in  November,  1852.

BOM  BARDMENT  OF  SEBASTOPOL.  brightness  by  the  breeze,  and  the  charred  ribs  were  all  that  remained  visible  to  th'e  teleeCope  .  from  the  Picket.  House  bill.  Long  before  this  consummation,  however,  two  ether  fires  broke  nut  within  the  town  itself—the  first,  and  smaller  of  the  two,  amongst  some  houses  near  the  cemetery,  and  the  larger  in  the  .  part  of  the  town  lying  in  the  rear  of  the  Redan.  The  locale  of  the  former  had  been  severely  shelled  by  the  Greenbill  battery  dur- iag the  afternoon  and  evening,  and  to  this  it  is  said  the  fire  in  that  quat  ter  is  to  be  attributed.  Atter  sunset  a  French  battery  on  the  left  commenced  throwing  rockets  over  the  Redan  into  the  town  ;  and  to  this,  I  be- lieve, the  second  burning  in  that  direction  is  to  be  traced.  This  last  raged  with  peculiar  fury  over  a  very  considerable  space,  and  when  I  turned  away  from  looking  at  it  long  after  midnight,  the  wind  was  extending  the  flames  to  several  other  buildings  adjacent  to  that  in  which  it  first  broke  out.  To  aid  the  breeze,  our  own  Quarry  battery  threw  3large  number  of  shells  into  the  spot  ;  whilst  the  French  at  the  same  time  continued  to  contribute  rockets  for  a  similar  purpese.  A  shell  from  one  of  our  own  mortar  batteries,  however,  accomplished  a  still  more  valuable  result,  by  blositi'ng  up  a  Russian  magazine  in  the  sin  -  all  six-gun  work  on  the  proper  right  of  the  Malakhoff.  This  oc- curred between  9  and  10  p.m.,  and  from  the  terrific  force  of  the  explosion  the  quantity  of  powder  ignited  must  have  been  great.  At  a  distance  of  more  than  a  mile  and  a  half  from  the  spot  the  earth  shook  again,  whilst  the  anise  resembled  a  thunder  peal.  The  full  extent  of  the  t.'arnage  cannot  be  known  till  deserters  reveal  it  ;  but  that  it  quite  balances  the  loss  sustained  by  the  French,  through  the  late  accident  in  the  Manaelon,  there  can  be  little  room  to  doubt.  Throughout  last  night  the  fire  continued  to  be  delivered  with  unabated  energy—the  enemy,  as  before,  giving  scarcely  a  shot  or  shell  in  re- turn. This  silence  on  their  part,  however,  is  far  from  proving  that  their  batteries  are  therefore  effectually  shut  up—the  delusion  into  which  we  fell  and  suffered  from  so  calamitously  on  the  18th  of  June.  We  have  reason  rather  to  suppose  that  their  guns  have  been  withdrawn  into  shelter,  ready,  if  necessary,  as  before,  to  vomit  forth  grape  and  canister  when  we  least  expect  either.  But  that  they  have  suffered  most  heavily  during  the  past  three  days,  in  men  and  materiel,  is  certain,  whilst  our  own  loss  has  been  much  lees  than  during  any  previous  bombardment.  During  the  whole  of  Thursday  after- noon an  almost  unbroken  string  of  stretcher-bearers,  carrying  away  the  dead  and  wounded,  could  be  seen  from  our  advanced  trenches  winding  out  of  the  Re- dan ;  and  several  times  as  they  crossed  a  point  within  the  town  where  four  streets  meet,  and  which  our  guns  in  the  Quarry  Battery  command,  two  of  these  last  gave  them  discharges  which  added  considerably  to  the  casualties  of  the  day.  The  humanity  of  firing  on  men  so  employed  may  be  questioned  ;  but  it  should  be  remembered  that  in  war  the  first  principle  of  action  should  be  that  which  will  inflict  the  greatest  loss  on  the  enemy  at  the  smallest  cost  to  ourselves  ;  and  to  carry  cut  this  refined  considerations  of  humanity  must  often  or  always  be  set  aside.  Thus  the  last  three  days  have  been  full  of  action  and  incident.  Even  while  I  write  every  one  is  on  the  qui  vice  of  expectation  as  to  the  next  move  on  the  part  of  the  generals.  Camp  rumour  declares  that  the  assault,  which  in  the  usual  course  of  things  should  follow  all  this  bombarding,  will  be  made  to-day  ;  but  beyond  this  gene- ral impression  I  can  as  yet  state  nothing.  To  bring  down  my  account  of  the  firing  and  its  consequences  to  the  latest  hour  I  have  delayed  writing  till  the  last  mo- ment in  time  for  post,  but  even  before  I  close  it  is  not  improbable  that  something  decisive  may  occur.  In  the  meantime  I  may  add  to  this  rapid  sketch  of  our  operations  since  the  outgoing  of  the  last  mail  a  few  further  particulars  of  some  of  the  occurrences  shortly  referred  to  in  my  letter  of  the  4th.  When  I  then  mentioned  the  affair  in  which  the  97th  Regiment  had  one  officer  killed  and  two  wounded  in  the  trenches  a  night  or  two  before,  and  added  that  the  matter  had  since  been  made  the  subject  of  an  official  investigation,  I  was  not  aware  of  the  extent  and  direction  of  the  blame  at- taching to  those  concerned.  Since  then  I  have  learned  the  facts  more  accurately,  and  they  are  briefly  these  :—On  the  night  in  question,  when  the  party  of  the  enemy  who  surprised  and  drove  in  our  sentries  before  the  advanced  approach  leading  from  the  fifth  parallel,  dashed  into  the  sap,  the  officers  of  the  covering  party  rushed  forward  to  meet  them  ;  but  the  men  first  hesitated,  and  then  turned;  only  some  8  or  10  of  them  remaining  with  their  officers.  The  immediate  result  was  the  death  of  one  of  the  latter,  and  severe  wounds  to  two  of  the  remainder.  These  run- aways were  mostly  fresh  drafts  belonging  to  the  97th  and  (I  believe)  the  17th  Regiments.  Fortunately,  Major  Turner,  of  the  7th,  who  was  field  officer  of  the  attack  for  the  night,  succeeded  in  mustering  a  strong  party  from  other  regiments  close  at  hand,  and  with  these  promptly  attacked  and  drove  out  the  Russians.  On  the  following  morning  Major  Turner  reported  the  conduct  of  the  runaways,  and  having  made  good  his  charge  before  the  committee  of  officers  appointed  to  investigate  it,  a  most  severe  and  well-deserved  rebuke  was  administered  to  the  peccant  regiments  in  a  general  order  of  last  even- ing. On  the  night  after  this  disgraceful  behaviour,  another  excellent  officer,  Captain  Ross,  of  the  3d  Buffs,  was  shot  down  in  repelling  another  sallying  party  from  the  Redan,  who  carried  him  off  as  they  retreated.  It  is  since  reported  that  he  has  died  within  the  town.  Forty-eight  hours  later  still,  on  Monday  night,  Cap- tain Pechell,  of  the  77th,  was  killed  on  the  same  ground,  in  a  most  injudiciously  ordered  attempt  (with  only  eight  men)  on  a  Russian  rifle-pit  some  thirty  yards  in  advance  of  the  further  extremity  of  the  sap.  They  had  scarcely  emerged  from  the  shel- ter of  the  parapet  before  a  volley  knocked  over  five  men  and  the  captain,  whose  body  was  dragged  back  into  the  trench  by  one  of  the  three  survivors.  Again,  on  Wednesday  night,  Capt.  Anderson,  of  the  31st,  who  leas  for  several  months  been  doing  duty  with  the  Engi- neers, was  shot  dead  by  a  rifle  bullet  inside  the  same  work  ;  and  on  Thursday  night,  Capt.  Buckley,  of  the  Grenadier  Guards,  met  with  a  similar  fate  almost  on  the  same  spot.  Thus  within  the  short  period  of  a  week,  this  trumpery  approach  has  cost  us  the  lives  of  five  most  valuable  officers  and  many  men.  These  have  constituted  the  main  weight  of  our  fatal  casualties  since  this  day  week,  but  in  all  sad  earnest  the  list  is  heavy  enough.  I  have  more  than  once  had  occasion  to  refer  to  the  dis- graceful behaviour  of  very  many  of  the  young  soldiers  who  are  being  continually  sent  out  hither  from  the  home  depots,  and  this  conduct  of  the  97th  and  17th  furnishes  another  painful  illustration  of  the  truth  of  my  remarks.  With  such  multiplied  examples  of  the  great  inferiority  of  these  raw  levies  before  their  eyes,  it  may  be  worth  while  for  the  home  authorities  to  con- sider whether  or  not  some  plan  be  practicable  by  which  none  but  old  troops  should  be  sent  out  hither—at  least  till  all  such  now  on  home  service  have  been  drafted  to  this  army.  As  it  is,  I  have  heard  more  than  one  com- manding officer  declare  that  he  would  prefer  short  num- bers of  the  latter  any  day  to  a  full  complement  made  up  for  the  most  part—  as  is  the  case  with  many  regiments  now  in  the  front—of  these  green  youths,  who  are  sol- diers only  in  appearance  and  name.  9  a.m.—As  was  to  be  expected,  the  assault  is  to  be  made  in  the  course  of  this  forenoon.  Since  early  dawn  this  morning  a  terrific  fire  along  the  whole  line,  left  and  right,  has  been  kept  up  on  the  enemy's  works  from  every  gun  and  mortar  that  could  be  brought  to  bear  on  any  part  of  them.  In  addition  to  the  Russian  batteries  on  the  pro.  per  right  of  the  town,  the  Redan  and  its  mischievous  six-gun  neighbour  have  replied  vigorously,  as  have  also  a  couple  of  batteries  from  the  north  side.  Only  one  gun  has  played  from  the  Malakhoff,  and  for  its  rare  shots  filly  fifty  for  one  have  been  returned.  All  through  the  night  the  allies  kept  up  a  murderous  cannonade,  and  at  this  moment  while  I  write  the  combined  discharges  re- semble one  long  unbroken  peal  of  thunder.  This  is  to  be  continued  till  the  signal  for  the  assault  is  given,  when  the  enemy  will  have  barely  time  to  greet  the  advancing  columns  with  one  discharge  of  grape.  This  time  the  ar-  LAST  HOURS  OF  THE  SIEGE.  (Fr(m.  the  Correspondent  of  the  Daily  News.)  C  ,  .t.,111P  BEFORE  SEBASTOPOL,  SKET.  8.  After  'Long  weeks  of  comparative  idleness  the  allied  batteries  have  again  opened  upon  the  besieged  town,  and  for  the  gi  'eater  part  of  three  days  havekept  up  an  almost  continuo'  as  bombardment  along  nearly  the  whole  of  the  attacking:  line.  This  time,  at  ail  event;  the  attention  of  the  gene  rals  commanding  was  kept  sufficiently  secret  ;  for  till  tl  le  thundering  cannonade  began  at  dawn  on  Wednesd  lay  morning  from  the  batteries  on  the  French  left,  I  ha  we  been  unable  to  hear  of  any  one,  out  of  the  narrow  c  circle  of  cenfidents  at  head-quarters,  who  was  at  all  a%  c  are  of  its  approach.  About  four  o'clock  on  the  morn  ing  of  the  sth,  however,  our  allies  opened  the  ball  from,  the  guns  of  their  left  attack,  and  maintained  a  most  'vigorous  fire  on  the  enemy's  works  in  that  direction  till  about  an  hour  and  a  half  after  noon,  -  when  our  own  batteries  and  those  on  the  French  r  ight  opened  on  the  Redan,  the  Malakhoff,  and  its  adjac  ,ant  supports  in  Careening  Bay.  From  that  hour  unt  it  shortly  before  5  o'clock,  a  feu  d'enfer  was  kept  up  along  the  whole  line,  to  which  only  the  Russian  batteries  opposed  to  the  French  left  replied  with  any- thing lik  e  sustained  vigour.  The  gunners  in  the  Redan  and  Roo  aid  Tower  contented  themselves  with  throwing  occasion  II  shells  into  our  advanced  works  and  the  Mame- lon, and  is  few  hollow  shot  which  came  bounding  up  to  the  close  neighbourhood  of  the  tents  along  the  front.  About  a  quarter'  before  5  o'clock  the  fire  on  both  sides  slackened  1,  and  an  hour  later  it  .  almost  ceased,  when  a  calm—in  ,striking  contrast  to  the  stormy  thunder  which  had  filled  the  air  and  clouded  the  sky  during  the  day—- succeedeo L,  and  remained  almost  undisturbed  till  the  light  of  dawn  ;',gain  came  to  guide  the  aim  of  the  -combatants.  Some  ts  co  hours  later,  however,  about  8  o'clock,  a.  lent  the  occurr  edscene.  toA  givelarge  rg  e  t  wo  decker,  picturesqueness  ecker,  lyingand  i  n  n  e  t  w  eres  ii  moored  cff  the  dockyard  shears,  suddenly  burst  into  limn,  e  ;  ;  and  in  considerably  less  than  half-an-hour  her  whol  ,  )  hull  and  rigging  were  one  mass  of  waving  fire.  None  but  a  most  graphic  pen  could  describe  the  grandeur  of  the  cot  tflagration,  as  it  brightened  and  extended  in  relief  aga  b  ist  the  pitchy  darkness  of  the  night,  throwing  up  clouds  of  smoke,  which  hung  in  lurid  masses  over  and  aron:  a  d  the  burning  ship,  till  the  whole  harbour,  from  Fort  Pau  I  to  the  north  shore,  was  covered  with  the  fleecy  vol  runes,  which  there  was  not  a  breath  of  wind  to  stir.  Th  a  red  glare  of  the  flames  threw  its  reflection  over  all  t  b  e  adjacent  buildings  and  shipping,  creating  a  picture  of  '  lights  and  shadows  such  as  only  the  pencil  of  Rembi  sindt  himself  could  have  worthily  reproduced  ;  whilst  al  ).  we  the  vapoury  canopy  that  overhung  the  vessel,  tl  to  sky  was  lighted  up  with  a  brilliance  which  rendered  the  outline  of  the  various  siege  works  before  the  town.  almost  as  visible  as  at  noonday.  The  only  sky-scene.  I  ever  saw  which  surpassed,  or  even  equalled  it,  was  an  autumn  -sunset  in  Mesopotamia,  when  the  long  even  line  of  the  desert  horizon  was  crowned  p  'ith  a  glory  of  which  no  combination  of  artifi- cial colons  s  could  ever  afford  an  adequate  resemblance.  About  twx  hours  after  the  first  outbreak  of  the  fire  there  were  two  trifling  explosions,  as  if  caused  by  the  ignition  of  spirits  to  r  the  firing  of  a  couple  of  powder  casks  ;  but  beyond  tht  se,  and  the  discharge  of  a  single  cannon,  there  was  no  rep  ort.  Shortly  before  midnight  the  decks  fell  in,  after  ati  hich  the  side  timbers  continued  to  burn  for  some  coup'  e  of  hours,  when  the  wreck  settled  down,  and  at  daylighit  ;  no  trace  of  her  remained  visible  above  the  water.  With  tll  e  grey  light  of  early  morning  on  Thursday  the  bombardu  ent  recommenced,  and  continued  throughout  the  day,  Iv  ith  some,  periods  of  intermittent  slackness.  As  on  the  ;  previous  day  its  strength  was  confined  to  the  French  an  d  our  own  left--the  batteries  on  the  right  doing  little  more  than  to  keep  up  a  dropping  fire  on  the  Malakhoff:  and  Little  Redan,  the  former  of  which  did  not  answer  wi  th  a  single  gun.  Soon  after  sunset,  however,  nearly  ewe  75  ,  mortar  along  the  whole  line  of  attack  was  brought  i  a  to  play,  and  till  nearly  9  the  thunder  of  their  discharge  s  rolled  through  the  air  in  almost  unbroken  peals  ;  the  sky  was  literally  alive  with  shells,  vomited  forth  froi  n  their  fiery  beds  at  every  angle  from  fifteen  de- grees up  to  seventy-five,  whilst  showers  of  the  still  grander  a  n  d  more  terrific  rockets  darted  across  the  dark- ness like  wenging  comets.  As  illustrating  the  briskness  of  the  fire  about  this  time  I  may  mention  that  within  four  minus  tes  I  counted  as  many  as  thirty-one  shells  fall- ing inside  the  Malakhoff  alone,  whilst  an  almost  equally  warm  prrbc  ace  was  being  kept  up  upon  its  formidable  neighbour  the  Redan.  As  throughout  the  previous  day  the  Mala  k  Koff  scarcely  fired  a  shot  in  reply,  almost  its  only  disci  u  erges  being  a  few  cohorns  thrown  over  the  pa- rapet into  ;the  French  sap,  whose  occupants  generally  gave  back  two  fc  ,  r  one.  The  Mamelon  to  a  great  extent  also  re- served its  fire,  leaving  its  vis-a-vis  to  be  dealt  with  by  our  21-gun  ar  ic  -  1  mortar  batteries  on  its  left.  About  half-past  nine  o'clo  k  another  fire  broke  out  behind  the  Round  Tower,  'b.icb,  though  inferior  in  extent  and  brilliance  to  that  of  -the  previous  night,  threw  up  volumes  of  smoke  and  flame,  that'  cast  a  flood  of  lurid  light  over  a  great  part  of  t'tie  harbour,  the  Arsenal,  the  Redan,  and  our  own  and  the  French  advanced  trenches.  After  burning  for  about  a  n  hour,  however,  it  rapidly  died  out,  having  been  in  ail  probability  one  of  the  buildings  on  the  slope  of  the  hill,  leading  down  from  the  rear  of  the  Malakhoff  to  the  barb  our.  During  the  hour  for  which  this  had  lasted  one  of  the  three-deckers,  which  had  been  drawn  up  dur- ing the  p  revious  night,  with  their  broadsides  to  the  Round  T  a  wer,  threw  several  shells  into  the  trenches  near  the  Mam  E  lon,  as  well  as  into  our  own  advanced  mortar  batteries  -on  its  flank,  but  as  the  French  replied  with  some  die  c  harges  of  rockets,  this  fire  from  the  shipping  was  not  I.‘  mg  continued.  The  glare  of  a  second  fire  within  the  town  was  visible  in  the  rear  of  the  Redan  ;  but  this  appeared  to  have  been  soon  got  under,  and  did  not  last  for  )  nom  than  half-an-hour.  As  on  Wednesday,  so  again  during  this  day's  practice,  the  enemy  fired  seve- ral shells  at  the  camp,  two  of  which,  that  I  have  heard  of,  took  effect.  The  first  fell  into  a  canteen-hut  in  the  Third  Diovision,  and  demolished  the  whole  concern,  at  the  same  time  wounding  the  luckless  Maltese  to  whom  the  store  belonged  ;  whilst  the  second  exploded  within  ,  and  killed  the  only  man  a  s  teat  n  hap  oopf  paned  the  F  t  o  o  u  r  b  t  e  h  D  insidei  vi  s  i  o  a  t  n  the  time,  besides  wound- ing three.  others  in  the  neighbourhood,  During  Thursday  night  the  firing  again  slackened,  but  was  resumed  on  Friday  at  daylight,  and  kept  up  vigorously  throughout  the  day—its  main  force  being,  as  c  ,  n  the  two  preceding  days,  from  the  left.  On  looking  at  the  Malakhoff  about  noon  I  was  able,  with  the  aid  of  a  good  glass,  to  perceive  the  full  extent  of  the  external  injury  which  it  bad  sustained  from  Wednes- day's and  Thursday's  fire,  and  of  the  entire  number  of  its  embrasures  only  two  remained  open.  The  rest  had  been  literally  bunged  up,  and  their  gabions  shattered  and  knocked  about  in  all  directions  inti  and  outside  the  ditch.  The  abattis,  which  bad  proved  so  formidable  an  obstacle  to  our  Allies  on  the  18th  of  June,  was  also  swept  away  in  various  places,  and  open- ings, varying  from  one  to  ten  yards,  were  visible  through- out the  greater  part  of  its  length  from  the  six-gun  battery  up  to  the  parapet  of  the  French  sap.  Similarly,  though  to  a  much  less  degree,  the  embrasures  of  the  Redan  had  been  damaged,  and  its  fascines  and  gabions  blown  out  of  place  ;  whilst  the  small  flanking  party  under  the  wing  of  the  Malakhoff  appeared  but  little  injured.  Passing  on  to  the  town  itself,  on  the  left,  a  vast  number  of  houses  which  had  before  escaped  uninjured  were  seen  reduced  to  ruins,  roofs  being  knocked  in,  side  walls  shattered,  or  gables  blown  clean  away.  From  the  roofs  of  several  of  the  public  buildings,  however,  the  sheet  lead  appears  to  have  been  purposely  stripped  ;  and  I  also  perceived  a  scaffolding  at  present  round  the  dome  of  the  small  tower  that  rises  out  of  the  Admiralty  buildings,  leading  to  the  impression  that  it  is  undergoing  the  same  denuding  process.  Altogether,  a  much  greater  proportion  of  the  fire  appears  to  have  been  this  time  directed  against  the  town  itself  than  on  any  previous  occasion,  and  the  da- mage inflicted  seems  to  be  commensurately  great.  Why  this  had  not  been  done  long  ago  has  been  a  standing  matter  for  remark  and  wonder  since  the  earliest  months  of  the  siege.  One  per  cent.  of  the  shot  and  shellthrown  resultlessly  into  the  Redan  and  Malakhoff  would  have  laid  the  town  in  ruins,  and  not  have  left  the  garrison  as  much  shelter  as  would  have  given  cover  to  a  rat.  About  5  p.m.  yesterday  another  ship  was  discovered  to  be  on  fire  near  the  middle  of  the  harbour,  and  almost  hidden  from  our  view  by  the  crest  of  the  Malakhoff  bill.  From  the  masts,  which  were  at  first  all  that  could  be  seen,  we  judged  her  to  be  a  frigate  ;  soon  after  the  first  outbreak  of  the  flames  she  appeared  to  be  to  wed  out  far- ther from  the  south  shore,  for  her  deck  and  one  tier  of  portholes  became  visible  above  the  brow  of  the  slope,  and  the  impression  as  to  her  size  was  then  confirmed.  Though  the  evening  was  windy,  and  an  impetus  therefore  given  to  the  flames,  she  continued  to  burn  steadily  till  nearly  an  hour  before  midnight,  when  the  blaze  gradually  subsided  to  a  smoulder,  fanned  into  rangement  is,  that  our  attack  on  the  Redan  shall  not  be  made  till  the  Malakhoff  is  actually  occupied  by  the  French  —then,  and  not  till  then,  our  stormers  shall  dash  on  to  the  Redan,  the  French  supporting  them  by  a  simultaneous  rush  upon  the  small  flanking  battery  which  worked  us  so  much  mischief  on  the  18th  June.  Our  assaulting  force  is  to  be  composed  of  the  whole  of  the  Second  Division,  and  the  second  brigade  of  the  Light  Division,  with  the  first  brigade  as  a  reserve.  As  a  punishment  for  its  recent  conduct  in  the  trenches  the  97th  has  been  told  off  to  lead.  General  Markham,  of  the  Second  Division,  commands  the  whole.  Such,  briefly,  is  to  be  the  order  of  this  final  attack,  and  the  strength  of  our  own  force  to  be  employed  in  it.  With  the  lesson  of  the  fatal  18th  fresh  in  all  minds  we  have  little  of  the  un- duly sanguine  confidence  of  success  which  then  ani- mated everybody  ;  but  with  our  advances  pushed  so  much  nearer  the  points  to  be  attacked,  and  with  ar- rangements free  from  the  complications  which  bore  such  disastrous  fruit  thf.,),  the  general  disappointment  will  still  be  great  if  before  sunset  to-day  the  Tricolour  and  Union  Jack  do  not  float  in  triumph  over  the  Malakhoff  and  Redan.  This  accomplished,  the  south  side  of  Sebas- topol is  our  own. ",newspapers//0002194/1855/0921/0002194_18550921_mets.xml,article

PAINLESS  TOOTH  EXTRACTION,  (WITHOUT  CHLOROFORM.)  BY  ROYAL  LETTERS  PATENT.  Mr.  ESKELL  is  the  only  DENTIST  privileged  to  use  the  Patent  in  LIVERPOOL.  A  new  and  elegant  IMPROVEMENT  connected  with  DENTAL  SURGERY  has  been  invented  by  MR.  ESKELL,  SURGEON  DENTIST,  No.  75,  RODNEY-STREET,  (CORNER  OF  UPPER  DUKE-STREET),  LIVERPOOL.  It  is  the  construction  of  an  entirely  new  description  of  ARTIFI- CIAL TEETH,  beautifully  Enamelled  and  of  the  most  exquisite  Workmanship,  from  Part  of  a  Tooth  to  a  Complete  Set,  and  is  composed  of  the  finest  Materials,  which  are  afterwards  Enamelled  to  resemble  the  Natural  Teeth,  in  every  Shade  and  Colour.  They  are  incorrodible,  (will  never  change  colour  or  decay,)  and  when  adapted  to  the  mouth  are  not  discernible  from  the  Natural  Teeth.  They  are  constructed  upon  Metals  of  unexceptionable  purity,  and  for  comfort  in  wearing  and  general  appearance  cannot  be  excelled.  Mr.  ESKELL  supplies  ARTIFICIAL  TEETH  upon  his  new  sys- tem of  SELF-ADHESION,  without  extracting  any  Teeth  or  Stumps.  Mr.  ESKELL  has  Specimens  in  every  variety,  and  will  be  happy  to  show  them  to  those  interested  in  the  subject,  when  their  pre-eminence  will  be  at  once  apparent,  and  this  statement  of  their  superiority  over  all  others  will  be  found  to  be  entirety  and  scrupulously  correct  ;  so  much  so  that  Mr.  EsicELL  will  g  ive  THREE  MONTHS'  TRIAL  WITHOUT  PAYMENT  ,  a  sufficient  guarantee  of  their  COMFORT,  EASE,  BEAUTY,  and  DURABILITY,  at  charges  strictly  moderate,  and  within  the  reach  of  the  most  economical.  Incorrodible  ARTIFICIAL  TEETH,  as  above,  from  TEN  SHILLINGS  EACH  TOOTH.  FILLING  DECAYED  TEETH  With  ESKELL'S  celebrated  WHITE  TERRA  PASTE,  which  never  changes  colour,  and  is  free  from  those  injurious  proper- ties found  in  ordinary  Stoppings.  It  is  applied  in  a  soft  state,  like  paste,  to  the  cavity  of  the  Tooth,  without  giving  the  slightest  pain,  and  in  a  few  minutes  it  becomes  as  hard  as  the  Enamel  of  the  Tooth  itself.  A  NEW  MODE  OF  EXTRACTING  TEETH,  BY  A  PATENT  FULCRUM,  By  which  means  the  Gums  cannot  be  lacerated,  the  danger  of  breaking  the  Tooth  prevented,  and  hmmorrhage  considerably  lessened;  and  the  Tooth  being  extracted  perpendicularly  and  almost  PAINLESS,  renders  Chloroform  unnecessary.  We  can  confidently  direct  attention  to  it  as  a  boon  to  the  profession  and  the  It  allows  of  the  extraction  of  teeth  in  the  most  scientific  and  easy  Times.  There  is  generally  so  much  difficulty  experienced  in  the  intro- duction of  any  novelty,  however  valuable,  especially  in  Medicine  or  Surgery,  and  that  difficulty  is  so  much  enhanced  if  the  inven- tion militates  against  preconceived  ideas,  and  old-established  and  cherished  modes  of  practice,  that  it  is  thought  desirable  to  pub- lish some  of  the  Testimonials  received  in  favour  of  the  Patent  Apparatus  from  some  of  the  many  persons  who  have  experienced  its  benefits.

WHATEVER  of  gratitude  is  due  to  Rome  from  the  Anglican  Church  on  account  of  the  mission  of  ST.  AUGUSTINE,  certain  it  is  that  the  debt  has  been  pretty  well_cancelled,  and  that,  upon  the  whole,  more  of  evil  than  of  good  has  resulted  to  us  from  our  former  con- nexion with,  and  subjection  to,  him  who  claims  to  be  the  successor  to  ST.  PETER.  At  this  moment  we  are  suffering  under  two  evils  :  the'  want  of  additional  Churches,  and  the  scanty  means  afforded  to  their  In- cumbents by  many  existing  ones.  But  how,  it  will  be  askdd,  is  Rome  answerable  for  this  P  We  say  not  that  the  blame  is  wholly  attributable  to  her,  but  doubt- less it  is  so  in  a  very  great  degree  ;  while,  if  she  had  exerted  the  mighty  power,  which  she  formerly  pos- sessed, less  for  selfish  ends,  and  more  for  the  good  of  the  Church  .  at  large,  there  is  little  doubt  but  that  she  might  have  hindered  altogether  the  proceedings  to  which  we  are  about  to  allude.  Our  readers  are,  of  course,  aware  that  of  benefices  some  are  called  Recto—- ries, and  others  Vicarages.  Whence  and  what  is  the  difference  between  the  two  P  Simply  this  :  all  were  originally  Rectories,  but,  from  time  to  time,  some  of  them  were  appropriated  to  Monasteries,  whose  mem- bers thenceforward  enjoyed  the  great  tithes,  and  appointed  a  Priest  to  discharge  the  duties,  who  had  for  his  maintenance  the  small  tithes  and  certain  other  dues.  This  was  bad  enough,  being  a  diversion  of  pro- perty from  those  purposes  to  which  its  original  donors  had  -  solemnly  dedicated  it.  And,  as  this  system  of  appropriation  flourished  under  the  sanction  of  the  Popes,  so  doubtless,  if  they  had  pleased,  they  might  at  least  have  greatly  restrained,  if  not  altogether  put  a  stop  -  to  it.  For  the  evil  which  followed,  as  a  conse-  (pence  of  this  system,  we  therefore  hold  them  to  be  indirectly  responsible.  The  monasteries  had  been,  to  a  large  extent,  endowed  by  the  robbery  of  the  parish  churches  ;  and,  at  length,  their  turn  came  to  fall  under  the  hand  of  the  spoiler.  They  were  suppressed  by  the  EIGHTH  HENRY,  and  their  possessions  lavished  upon  his  creatures  ;  and  hence  it  comes  to  pass  at  this  day,  that  not  only  Abbey-lands,  but  the  tithes  belonging  to  particular  parishes,  are  in  the  possession  of  laymen  ;  while  the  Incumbents  of  those  parishes  are,  in  many  instances,  doing  the  work  for  incomes  which  are  utterly  inadequate  to  their  maintenance.  Windy  de- magogues not  unfrequently  take  the  wealth  of  the  Church  for  their  text  ;  while  sums  of  fabulous  amount  are  stated  as  the  incomes  of  her  Bishops  and  Clergy.  It  will,  however,  surprise  a  good  many  people  to  learn  that  no  less  than  four  thousand  parishes  in  England  and  Wales  have  their  tithes  either  wholly  or  partially  alienated  from  them,  and  that  the  gross  amount—of  which  they  have  been  thus  sacrilegiously  robbed—- exceeds a  million  and  a  half  annually.  Could  the  Church  recover  this  sum,  there  would  be  little  difficulty  in  supplying  all  her  wants,  many  and  urgent  though  they  be.  We  have  been  led  to  these  remarks  by  a  perusal  of  the  Report,  for  1855,  of  a  society  little  known,  but  de- serving extensive  support.  The  title  which  it  assumes  is,  The  Tithe  Redemption  Trust  for  the  Church  in  England  and  and  its  objects  are  as  follows  :  1.  To  give  to  owners  of  alienated  Tithes  an  oppor- tunity of  restoring  them  to  the  spiritual  purposes  for  which  they  were  originally  ordained,  and  to  assist  them  in  so  doing.  2.  To  apply  any  Tithes  thus  restored  towards  relieving  the  spiritual  destitution  of  the  Parish  or  Chapelry  whence  they  arise,  by  adding  to  the  endow- ment of  such  Parish  Church  or  Chapel,  or  by  the  endow- ment of  new  districts  therein.  3.  To  apply  to  Parlia- ment to  facilitate  the  means  of  accomplishing  these  And,  that  its  funds  are  not  likely  to  be  ap- plied to  party  purposes,  will,  we  think,  be  evident,  by  a  glance  at  the  names  of  the  trustees.  The  Trust  has  only  been  in  existence  five  years,  and  is  yet  but  little  known  :  its  income  is  consequently  small,  and  its  means  of  accomplishing  its  two  first  objects  very  limited.  But  we  regard  its  third  pro- fessed object  as  of  at  least  equal  importance;  and  had  it  effected  nothing  more  than  the  removal  of  one  of  the  restrictions  imposed  by  the  law  of  mortmain,  it  would  have  clone  much,  and  deserved  well  of  the  Church.  HOwever  necessary  that  law  may  have  been  at  its  first  passing,  there  is  no  doubt  that  it  has  acted  prejudi- cially to  the  best  interests  of  the  Church  in  later  times,  by  preventing  such  provision  for  the  spiritual  wants  ot.  the  people  as  would  otherwise  have  been  made.  Tithes,  once  belonging  to  the  Church,  but  since  alien- ated and  held  by  laymen,  could  not  be  given  back  again  by  will.  This  restriction  no  longer  exists;  for,  through  the  efforts  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Trust,  a  clause  was  introduced  into  13  and  14  Vic.,  c.  94,  sec.  23,  enabling  their  possessors  to  make  posthumous  restitution.  We  repeat,  that  if  nothing  else  had  been  effected,  this  would  be  much  ;  and  we  would  venture  to  express  a  hope,  that  the  means  put  at  the  Trust's  disposal  will  be  largely  augmented,  as  its  objects,  and  what  it  has  already  accomplished,  become  more  generally  known  and  appreciated.  It  has  already  a  branch  association  established  in  Liverpool,  including  the  names  of  several,  both  clergy  and  laity,  who  are  ever  found  foremost  in  every  good  work  :  but,  assuredly,  this  great  town  ought  to  do  more  than  it  has  yet  done.  In  conclusion,  we  beg  to  call  the  attention  of  our  readers  to  an  advertisement  connected  with  this  subject,  which  appears  in  our  co- lumns to-day.  FROM  OUR  LONDON  CORRESPONDENT.  MONDAY  MORNING.  POPULAR  impatience  has  long  formed  a  theme  for  the  poli- tical moralist.  In  few  instances  has  the  general  weakness  been  more  signally  or  more  universally  displayed  than  in  re- lation to  the  intelligence  which  day  by  day  has  been  expected  from  the  Crimea.  Two  long  and  anxious  weeks  have  now  elapsed  since  the  people  of  these  kingdoms  were  apprised  of  the  success  which  had  rewarded  the  sustained  courage  and  active  bravery  of  the  Allied  armies,  in  their  arduous  and  pro- tracted endeavours  to  reduce  Sebastopol.  A  year  or  two  ago,  the  intimation  of  the  ultimate  and  crowning  results  could  not  have  been  communicated  in  double  the  length  of  time;  now  all  classes  are  clamorous  and  dissatisfied,  because  we  have  not  as  yet  received  ample  details,  not  only  of  what  has  been  done,  but  also  in  reference  to  what  is  expected  to  follow  from  the  great  event  itself.  True,  portions  of  those  eagerly  coveted  details  have,  from  time  to  time,  been  communi- cated, but  these  have  not  been  sufficient  to  satiate  the  general  curiosity,  and,  so  far  from  satisfying,  they  have  only  tended  to  whet  the  public  appetite  for  news.  The  more  frank  commu- nications of  General  PELISSIER  have  been  contrasted  with  the  laconic  announcements  'of  General  SIMPSON,  greatly  to  the  disadvantage  of  the  latter  as  an  efficient  narrator  of  interest- ing events.  At  length  his  official  dispatch  has  been  handed  over  to  the  .public,  and  that  sapient  body  finds  itself  not  greatly  wiser  than  it  was  before.  The  most  gratifying  feature  in  the  document  referred  to  is  its  confirmation  of  the  entire  success  of  the  operations  directed  against  Sebastopol.  From  this  despatch,  or,  more  properly  speaking,  from  the  scraps  of  intelligence  which  it  rather  countenances  than  con- firbls, enough  can  be  gleaned  to  justify  conjecture  as  to  the  probabitty  of  future  operations,  and  to  warrant  the  indulgence  of  those  raptures  of  satisfaction  with  the  tidings  of  the  over- throw of  Sebastopol  by  which  they  were  at'  first'  greeted.  Observing  men  of  all  Parties  concur  in  the  opinion  that,  by  the  conquest,  of  that  stronghold,  a  vital  blow  has  been  struck  'at  Russian  domination.  The  prestige  of  superiority  in  military  matters,  which  the  partisans  and  parasites  of  Russia  so  inces- santly inculcated,  has  been  dispelled.  The  carefully  and  stealthily  accumulated  preparations  for  aggressive  warfare,  which  for  more  than  a  quarter  of  a  century  have  been  sedu- lously pushed  forward  by  Russia,  have  been  torn  from  her  grasp  and  shown  to  the  world.  Explanations  of  Russian  po- licy henceforward  receive  their  truest  elucidation  in  the  spoils  of  Sebastopol.  No  amount  of  credulity  will  now  be  sufficient  to  induce  the  belief  that  such  an  enormous  aggregation  of  military  and  naval  stores  could  be  deemed.part  of  a  dgensive  provision  for  Sebastopol.  Four  thousand  pieces  of  cannon,  together  with  the  vast  stores  of  the  munitions  of  war,  fallen  into  the  hands  of  the  captors,  point  unmistakeably  to  the  fact  that  Sebastopol  was  the  centre  of  Russian  designs  against  the  territory  of  the  East.  The  reduction  of  Constantinople,  though,without  doubt,  the  main,  was  not  the  only  object  aimed  at  by  the  concentration  of  so  vast  an  amount  of  military  and  naval  preparation  as  perhaps  was  never  before  equalled.  From  this  fortress  were  also  intended  to  be  drawn  the  materials  of  war  to  be  directed  against  Circassia  and  the  Transcaucasian  provinces.  Here  was  likewise  concentrated  that  fleet  which,  by  such  feats  of  arms  as  the  massacre  of  Sinope,  was  meant  to  annihilate  rivalry  on  the  Black  Sea;  and,  by  exterminating  an  adverse  navy,  convert  the  Euxine  into  a  Russian  lake.  If  this  conclusion  be  considered  too  sweeping,  let  him  who  de- murs cast  a  glance  at  the  results.  The  fleet  assembled  at  Se- bastopol, when  the  Allies  invaded  the  Crimea,  consisted  of  one  hundred  and  eight  vessels,  five  of  which  carried  each  a  hun- dred and  twenty  guns,  the  aggregate  number  of  guns  carried  by  this  formidable  navy  being  not  less  than  two  thousand  two  hundred.  Not  even  the  imaginative  scribe  who,  in  the  co- lumns of  Le  Nord,  describes  the  Russian  flight  from  Sebas- topol as  a  master-stroke  of  strategy,  can  hope  to  demonstrate  the  necessity  of  such  a  flotilla  in  an  inland  sea  as  a  merely  defensive  measure.  As  already  remarked,  the  amount  of  cap- tured warlike  spoils  has  been  immense,  and  the  character  of  these  spoils  is  hardly  less  significant  than  their  extent.  Five  hundred  thousand  pounds  weight  of  gunpowder  have  already  been  secured,  together  with  a  hundred  thousand  rounds  of  shot  and  shell,  and  more  of  both  are  yet  expected  to  be  met  with.  Not  an  ounce  of  grain  or  food  of  kny  sort  is  men- tioned as  having  fallen  into  the  hands  of  the  victors.  This  is  too  remarkable  a  fact  to  be  passed  over  in  silence.  The  retreat  of  the  Russians  was  too  precepitate  to  admit  of  their  carrying  with  them  in  great  quantity  commissariat  stores  ;  but,  if  they  had  not  time  to  carry  off  food,  they  had  still  less  time  for  destroying  it.  A  flying  enemy,  which  has  not  time  to  carry  off  its  wounded,  could  not  have  had  time  to  carry  away  stores  of  provision  —a  fugitive  host,  which  had  to  decamp,  leav- ing behind  it  two  hundred  and  twenty  odd  tons  of  gunpowder,  was  not  likely  to  have  time  for  the  effectual  destruction  of  its  food.  If  no  food  was  left,  then  the  conjecture  seems  at  least  a  feasible  one,  which  attributes  its  absence  to  previous'exhaustion.  This  subject  has  attracted  great  attention  in  military  circles.  If  the  granaries  of  Sebastopol  were  exhausted,  it  is  no  wide  stretch  of  fancy  to  suppose  that  the  north  forts  and  the  encampments  on  the  MacKenzie  heights  had  no  provi- sions to  supply  them  with  ;  and  that  even  their  more  distant  sources  of  supply  were  empty.  Should  this  conjecture  prove  a  true  one,  with  what  chance  or  hope  of  success  can  the  Rus- sian army  attempt  to  hold  its  ground  through  the  now  rapidly-approaching  winter  ?  Their  position,  in  such  a  case,  must  be,  indeed,  a  hopeless  one.  Within  a  few  weeks,  sup- pose no  hostile  force  were  near  them,  their  connexion  with  the  grain  -producing  districts  of  Russia  will  be  effectually  cut  off  by  the  weather  and  the  impassable  state  of  the  roads.  The  pro-Russian  journals  and  advocates  of  all  kinds,  ostentatiously,  although  no  doubt  with  great  exaggeration,  represent  the  Russian  army  of  the  Crimea  as  still  200,000  strong.  How,  it  is  asked,  can  such  an  army  be  supported  in  the  southern  por-  tion  of  the  Crimea  during  the  next  six  months  P  Consideration  of  this  important  question  favours  the  conjecture  that  no  time  will  be  lost  by  Prince  GORTSCHA.KOFF  in  leading  his  army  out  of  the  Crimea;  but  this,  if  not  effected  speedily,  will  be  impossible.  Should  the  attempt  to  evacuate  the  Crimean  peninsula  be  delayed  till  after  the  commencement  of  the  winter,  a  retreat  then  undertaken  would  be  as  fatal  as  the  disastrous  retreat  from  Moscow  was  to  the  French,  in  1812.  Whatever  policy  is  to  guide  the  Russian  councils  in  reference  to  its  defensive  operations  must  be  undertaken  without  delay,  and  acted  on  with  promptitude.  Whatever  this  may  be,  the  gain  of  the  allies  from  the  fall  of  Sebastopol  begins  to  manifest  itself  on  all  hands;  and  it  seems  difficult  to  over-estimate  the  advantages  accruing  from  it.  The  actual  material  trophies,  although  seldom  equalled  and  never  surpassed  in  war,  are  pro- bably the  least  important  portion  of  the  benefit.  It  has  broken  the  factitious  prestige  with  which  the  Russians  had  contrived  A  invest  their  military  pretensions,  and  which,  even  in  the  ruin  of  defeat,  they  seek  to  bolster  up  by  ill-timed  bravado.  In  addressing  his  army,  the  CZAR  says.  The  prolonged  de- fence of  Sebastopol,  a  defenee  almost  unexampled  in  the  annals  of  war,  has  fixed  the  attention  not  only  of  Russia  but  of  entire  Anything  more  bombastically  absurd;or  more  his- torically untrue  than  this  it  is  not  easy  to  conjecture.  The  defence  of  Sebastopol,  though  dogged,  and  obstinately  pro- tracted, is  not  by  any  means  almost  unexampled  in  the  annals  of  war.  In  numerous  instances  we  read  of  more  protracted  defences,  in  the  annals  of  ancient  war;  but  without  falling  back  much  beyond  our  own  day,  it  will  be  found  that  the  defence  of  Saragossa  was  more  chivalrous  and  spirited  ;  and  if  the  siege  of  Gibraltar  be  referred  to,  it  will  be  apparent  that  Sebastopol,  with  all  its  boasted  Russian  glories,  falls  infinitely  short  of  that  extraordinary  defence  which  was  conducted  against  the  combined  forces  of  France  and  Spain  for  no  less  a  period  than  four  years,  terminating  with  the  utter  defeat  of  the  besieging  fleets  and  armies—a  result  in  which  it  signally  differed  from  that  of  Sebastopol.  Aproverb  informs  us,that  whatever  is  asserted  with  sufficient  pertinacity  and  boldness,  secures  implicit  credence.  The  in- vincibility of  Russia  is  one  of  those  drafts  on  public  credulity  which  has  obtained  currency  entirely  from  the  boldness,  with  which  the  mendacious  statement  has  been  made.  One  fact,  not  the  least  remarkable,  connected  with  the  statement  referred  to,  is  the  belief  it  has  secured  in  quarters  where  superior  in- formation might  reasonably  have  been  expected.  Thus  )  not  long  ago,  the  gallant  soldier  and  veteran  warrior  Sir  GEORGE  BROWN  informed  his  wondering  countrymen,  at  a  public  banquet  given  to  him  at  Elgin,  that  Russia  is  the  most  gigantic  military  power  ever  seen  on  Such  en  opinion  expressed  by  such  a  man  is  apt  to  produce  effects  the  most  mischievous.  If  analysed,  the  averment  will  be  found  to  weigh  but  little.  The  population  of  Russia  is  estimated  at  60,000,000,  but  these  it  should  be  remembered  are  spread  over  CP  space  equivalent  to  nearly  one-seventh  of  the  habitable  globe:  She  has  few  roads,  and  is  subject  to  all  the  rigours  of  an  extreme  climate  ;  her  people  are  ignorant  passive  serfs  ;  her  sea.board'  is  small  and  bad  ;  and  her  resources  are  scanty.  These  circum- stances, if  duly  marshalled  and  applied,  render  her  a  formidable  military  power  for  resistance,  but  detract  from  her  importance  as  an  aggressive  power.  Hence  it  will  be  seen  all  through  her  history,  that  her  acquisitions  have  been  rather  the  result  of  politic  cunning  and  patient  greed  than  of  bold!  aggres- sion. The  vast  stores  which  she  has  been  able  to  accu- mulate at  one  or  two  particular  points  (as  at  Sebastopol),  offer  no  contradiction  to  the  general  truth  of  these  remarks;  and  the  fact  that,  with  all  her  energies  devoted  to  the  task  of  protect- ing these  stores  by  every  contrivance  afforded  by  science  and  by  art  has  not  enabled  Russia  to  render  them  available  against  an  enemy,  or  even  to  preserve  them  for  her  own•  use,  is  the  strongest  possible  evidence  that  she  is  not  a  gigantic  military  Wherever  her  troops  have  •  encountered  those  of  the  Allies,  a  uniform  fate—defeat—has  awaited  the  Russian  arms,  whether  acting  on  the  defensive  or  as  assail- ants. In  short,  the  great  sham  of  military  superiority  has  been  cudgelled  out  of  them.  Dispirited  ands.  discouraged,  after  a  dogged  defence  of  the  strongly  fortified  positions  of  Sebastopol,  they  precipitately  decamped  while  a  stern  resis- tance was  still  within  their  power,  and  are  •  no*,  so  far  as  present  appearances  warrant  a  conjecture,  itt:the  extreme  of  a,  military  dilemma.  The  spirits  of  our  own  brave  fellows  are-in  high  order,  and:,  notwithstanding  the  privations  and  labours  to  which  they  have  been  so  long  inured,  they  retain  a  taste  for  jocularity  and  a  relish  for  fun  which  speak  favourably  of  their  mental.  and  physical  condition.  Their  excellent  spirits  are  referred  to  by  the  correspondents  of  most  of  the  journals  ;  and  one  i  ,  ,as  an  illustration,  alludes  to  the  dramatic  performances,  at  the  Theatre  '  Royal,  Naval  From  the  bill  ant.  nouncing  these,  it  is  seen  that  the  pieces  performed,  before  a  really  distinguished  were  Deaf  as  a  the  ``  Silent  and,  -  appropriately  enough,  Slasher  and  The  correspondent  alluded  to  noting  the  -perfor- mances- in  the  following  terms.:-  -  And  right  well  they  played.  True,  the  theatre  was..  the  amputating  house  of  the  Brigade,  but  no  reflections  as  to  its  future  and  past  use  marred  the  sense  of.  present  enjoyment.  The  scenes  were  furnished  from  '  The  London,'  the  actors  from  the  men  of  the  Brigade.  There  was  an  agreeable  ballet  girl  who  had  to  go  into  the  trenches  to  work  a  68-pounder  at  three  o'clock  in  the  morning,  and  Rosa  was  impersonated  by  a  prepossessing  boatswain's  mate.  Songs  there  were  in  plenty,  with  a  slight  smack  of  the  forecastle,  and  a  refrain.  of  big  guns  booming  down  the  ravine  from  the  front;  but  they  were  all  highly  appreciated,  and  the  dancing  was  pronounced  to  be  worthy  of  her  BIAJEsT)es,  ere  TERPSICHORE  and  116.

Nor  were  fashionable  and  illustrious  personages  wanted  to  grace  the  performance  with  their  presence,  and  to  relieve  the  mass  of  two  thousand  com- moners who  cheered,  and  laughed,  and  applauded  so  good- humouredly.

While  cursorily  glancing  the  mind's  eye  over  the  past  of  the  Crimea,  the  question  forcibly  obtrudes  itself,  what  of  the  future  ?

While  Sebastopol,  and  with  it  the  superiority  of  the  Crimea,  remains  in  the  hands  of  the  Allies,  the  power  and  predomi- nance of  Russia  is  destroyed,  not  merely  in  the  Black  Sea,  but  in  all  the  countries  which  surround  its  margin,  and  by  which  alone  she  has  obtained  access  to  them.  The  allied  fleets,  now  relieved  from  the  blockade  of  Sebastopol,  are  in  a  condition  to  strike  a  terrible  and  decisive  blow  at  Odessa,  or  at  any  other  of  the  Russian  seaports  in  the  south-east  of  Europe,  or  the  west  of  central  Asia.  The  struggle  which  has  placed  the  AllieS  in  this  position  has  been  a  formidable  one;  and  whatever  may  be  the  current  of  events,  humanity,  justice,  and  policy,  demand  that  the  Crimea  should  not  be  restored  to  Russia.  The  powerful  lesson  she  has  been  taught  in  the  loss  of  Sebastopol  will  not  be  lost  upon  her.  If  she  regain  possession  of  that  stronghold,  however  that  possession  may  be  fettered  by  the  paper  restric- tions of  well-drawn  treaties,  '  all  her  course  of  existence  concurs  in  showing  that  she  will  again  convert  it  into  a  means  of  enabling  her  to  make  a  swoop  upon  Constantinople,  with  this  difference,  that  in  the  second  instance  she  will  not  content  herself  with  rendering  its  fortress  impregnable  by  sea  alone,  but  will  so  dispose  its  land  defences  as  to  convert  Sebastopol  into  the  Gibraltar  of  the  Euxine.  For  any  serious  operation  against  Constantinople  a  fleet  is  indispensable  to  Russia.  This,  with  Sebastopol  in  her  possession,  she  will  speedily  re-acquire  if  the  Crimea  be  retained,  by  the  Allies  establishing  a  mode  rate  land  force  with  proper  defences  at  Perekop,  and  a  smal  squadron  of  ships  at  Sebastopol,  her  capability  as  an  aggres  sive  power  in  the  East  is  annihilated.  The  experiences  of  the  Crimean  campaign  have  been  in  some  respects  anomalous  when  viewed  in  connexion  with  the  ordinary  routine  of  military*  matters,  not  the  least  remark- able of  the  anomalies  being  the  introduction  of  civilians  into  the  camp.  The  pioneers  in  this  species  of  innovation  were  the  able  volunteer  corps  of  correspondents  for  the  London  press,  a  body  of  men  to  whom  the  army  and  the  nation  are  deeply  indebted  for  the  intrepidity  and  skill  with  which  they  combatted  and  conquered  a  foe  as  fell  as  that  which  lay  behind  the  defences  of  Sebastopol.  The  next  novelty  was  the  intro- duction of  a  corps  of  navvies,  and  the  formation  of  a  rail  Way,  not  of  the  best  construction  as-  some  rumours  say;  bwt  still  a  veritable  railway  to  the  camp.  Next  comes  the  organization  of  what  is  called  the  Army-Works  Corps,  entrusted,  of  all  people'  on  earth,  to  Sir  Joni's  PAXTON.

The  cir- cumstance referred  to,  it  will  be  readily  perceived,.  is  the  good  fortune  which  has  attended  it  in  being,  selected  as  the  Academy's-prize  picture.  The  picture,  or  rather-the  pictures,  for  there  are  two  of  them,  although  surrounded  by  one  frame,  is  designated,  Life  and  Death  of  by  Mr.  Augustus  L.  Egg,  A.R.A.  .  and  with  this  meagre  information  and,  the  aid  of  two  scenes  theatrically  contrasted,  together  with  the  peculiarity  of  the  costume  in  the.first,  the  spectator  is  supposed  to  know  that  the  artist's  intention  is  to  represent  the  style  of  life,  and  to  ,  typify  the  miserable  death  of  the  pro- gigate favourite  of  Charles  Its  The  precise  rule  by  which  the  awards  its  eoronal  is  not  very  easily  comprehended- by a  reference  to  its  past  practice,  and  the.present  award  does-,  not-  go  far  in  the  way  of  clearing_  up  whatever  mystery.  may  have  heretofore  attached  to  it.  Whatever  the  rule  may  be,  however,,  is  of  less  consequence  in  the  present  instance  than  the  fact  that  by  its  deliberate  judgment  it  has  accorded  a  premium  to  a.  work  of  art  peculiar  in  ,  its.  construction,  and  thereby,  so  far  as  the  Academy  has  the  power  to  do  so,  conferring  on,  that  the  character  of  a  praise-.  worthy  style  of  art.  There  is,not  much  of  novelty  in  an  artist,  who  intends  to  convey  a  moral,  having  recourse  to  a  series  of  tableaux,  in  which  he  shall  work  out  the  successive  scenes  of  his  pictorial  drama.  IT..tgarth  was,  a  master  in  his,  line  of  delineative  teaching  ;  but  in.  his.painted  satires  the.gradations  of  character  and  incident  were  close  and  rapidly  successive.  The  spectator  was  impelled  through  the  various.  steps  of  the  hero  or  heroine's  progress  in  such  a  manner  as  •to  leave.  nothing;  untold.  Such  is  not  the  ease.  in  the  dug  representation  before  us.  In  the  first,  we  are  introduced  to  a  scene  of  riotons  profligacy,  in  which  wine  and  wa  ss  ail  an  d  questionable  women  form  the  leading  features  ;  in  the  next  a  wretched  bedstead,  with  miserable  hangings,  and  the  ,  few  trifling  accessories.  introduced,  betoken  squalor  and  desertion  ;  while  a  minute  investigationleads  to  the  farther  knowledge  that  on  that  deserted  pallet  is  stretched,  la  the  agonies.  of  death,  the  once  gay  and  licentious  Buckingham.  The  contrast  is  too  sudden  ;  the  mind  is  unable  to  comprehend  so  total  a  reverse,  and  the  incidents,  and  consequently  much  of  the  teaching  of  the  story,  are  lost.  This,  in  an  ethical  point  of  view,  is  a  serious  drawback  to  the  pictures  as  a  painted  moral.  If  their  claims  in  this  respect  are  to  be  with- drawn, or  greatly  modified,  their  attributes  as  works  of  art  will  scarcely  stand  them  in  much  stead.  In  the  first  scene,  the  principal  figure,  that  of  Buckingham  himself,  seems  to  be  ornamented  with  a  head  entirely  inanimate  and  immoveable,  the  eyes  alone  being  capable  of  motion,  while  the  features  are  rigid  and  inexpressive.  In  the  second  the  ghastly  bead  is  al- most lost  in  the  monotonous  semi-tones  of  leaden  gray  by  which  it  is  surrounded;  and  the  intended  moral  of  the  picture  is  but  scurvily  carried  out  by  the  faithful  delineation  of  the  velvet  breeches  in  which  the  dying  man  is  attired,  and  the  ostenta- tious display  of  the  garter,  which  hangs  over  the  bed.  Th  e  treatment  of  both  parts  of  the  subject  indicates  a  poverty  of  artistic  resources,  and  a  barrenness  of  invention  incompatible  with  pretensions  to  the  highest  consideration  of  artistic  excel- knee, and  such  as  might  with  justice  lead  to  doubt  as  to  their  right  to  a  place  in  the  secondary  rank  of  art.  Faulty  drawing,  and  heavy,  opaque  colouring  are  conspicuous  features  in  the  work  which  the  Liverpool  Academy,  in  the  exercise  of  its  wis- dom, has  thought  right  to  honour.  Whether,  in  doing  so,  it  is  conducing  to  the  progress  of  legitimate  art,  or  lending  its  in- fluence in  an  opposite  direction,  may  well  admit  of  question.  N  0.128.

For  some  time,  it  appears,  differences  of  opinion  have  existed  between  the  incum- bent, the  Rev.  Dr.  Hilcoat,  who  of  late  had  been  absent  from  Liverpool,  and  the  Rev.  Henry  Cooke,  who  had  been  doing  duty  in  Dr.  Hilcoat's  absence.  In  the  dis- pute between  the  rev.  gentlemen  it  would  appear  the  ma- jority of  the  congregation  took  part  with  Mr.  Cooke,  while  some  antlered  to  the  side  of  the  incumbent.  Dr.  Hilcoat  had  intended  to  conduct  the  services  on  Sunday,  haying  previously  announced  his  intpntion  to  do  so.  Ile  ascended  the  reading  desk;  but  had  proceeded  no  further  than  Dearly  when  nearly  the  whole  con  grega  ti  on  rose  simultaneously,  and  with  few  exceptions  walked  out  of  the  church  in  a  body.

VIOLENT  ASSAULT  ON  A  POLICE•CONSTABLE.—JOhn  Driscoll,  a  dirty-looking  fellow,  with  only  a  few  rags  on  his  person,  'and  a  beard  of  a  fortnight's  growth,  the  very  beau  ideal  of  a  drunken  Irish  tailor,  who  are  always  worse  clothed  than  any  other  person,  was  charged  with  committing  a  violent  assault  on  Henry  Cotton,  a  police- constable, No.  60  H.  The  policeman  stated  that  the  prisoner  was  very  dis- orderly on  Tower-bill  last  night,  and  shouting  and  screaming  loudly.  He  interfered  with  the  prisoner,  who  began  kicking  him  as  hard  as  he  was  able,  and  swore  he  would  kick  him  to  pieces.  He  took  the  prisoner  into  custody,  and  he  acted  in  a  most  obstreperous  manner,  struck  him  repeatedly,  and  at  last  fell  on  the  ground  and  kicked  and  plunged  violently.  He  obtained  other  assistance,  and  conveyed  the  prisoner  to  the  station- house. The  prisoner  had  been  in  custody  before  for  dis- orderly conduct,  and  was  a  most  troublesome  character.  Mr.  Yardley—When  was  the  prisoner  in  custody  before  I  Roche,  the  gaoler—He  was  here  a  very  few  days  ago  for  riotous  and  disorderly  conduct.  Mr.  Yardley  sentenced  the  prisonor  to  14  days'  im- prisonment in  the  House  of  Correction.  ASSAULT  BY  AN  AMERICAN  SEAMAN.—  William  Long,  an  American  seaman,  who  only  arrived  in  this  port  yes- terday, was  charged  with  assaulting  John  Ryan,  a  police- constable, 214  H.  Ryan  stated  that  he  found  the  prisoner  asleep  at  an  early  hour  this  morning  under  an  arch  of  the  Blackwall  Railway.  Upon  arousing  him,  the  prisoner  knocked  him  down,  and  when  he  got  up  kicked  him  and  struck  him  under  the  ear.  He  called  for  assistance,  and  four  came  to  his  aid  and  secured  the  prisoner,  who  was  very  much  intoxicated.  Mr.  Yardley  fined  the  prisoner  405.,  which  he  paid.  ROBBEitY  BY  A  DIITCHMAN.—Johannas  Jandersloan,  a  Dutchman,  was  brought  before  Mr.  Yardiey  charged  with  stealing  a  pint  pot  and  two  drinking  glasses.  Henry  Geels,  barman  at  the  Sun  and  Sawyers  public- house, in  Whitechapel,  said  the  prisoner  was  drinking  at  the  house  in  company  with  other  foreigners  yesterday.  As  the  prisoner  was  leaving  the  house  a  person  called  attention  to  him,  and  he  detained  him  and  found  a  pint  pot  tied  behind  his  back  and  two  drinking  glasses  in  his  pockets.  They  belonged  to  Mr.  Junge,  the  landlord  of  the  house.  A  foreigner  said  the  prisoner  came  to  this  country  last  Sunday  to  join  the  Foreign  Legion,  and  he  was  rejected.  The  British  Government  would  take  no  more  Dutchmen,  because  they  were  constantly  quar- relling with  the  Germans  in  the  Legion.  Many  Ger- mans had  deserted  in  consequence  of  the  bad  conduct  of  the  Dutch.  Mr.  Yardley—The  prisoner  is  a  very  dis- honest man,  and  the  Foreign  Legion  has  had  a  very  lucky  escape.  I  sentence  him  to  one  month's  bard  labour  in  the  House  of  Correction. ",newspapers//0002194/1855/1004/0002194_18551004_mets.xml,article

It  states  that  the  receipts  of  the  South-Eastern  Company,  for  the  half-year  ending  the  31st  of  July  last,  amounted  to  438.7791.  The  working  expenses  and  re- newals amounted  to  200;456/.  ;  the  rates,  takes,  tolls,'  and  Government  duty  to  33,6551.  ;  the  rents  'of  the  Greenwich  Railway,  Deptford  Creek-bridge,  and  Anger- stein branch  and  wharf,  to  23,220/  ;  sures,  in  addition  to  62,6381.,  the  interest  of  the  mortgage  debt  20  5001.  South-Eastern'  Annuities  ;  and  13,7681.  gua- ranteed stock,  make  a  total  deduction  from  the  gross  .earnings  of  .354,239/.  The  profit  and  .  loss  account  shOws  a  balance  of  13;887/.  from  the  last  account,  as  ,well  as'll,4Bll.  the  net  earnings  at  the  credit  of  the  steam-boat  account,  and  is  debited  with  4,096/.  for  Par- lisunentary awl  other  expenses,  leaving  a  disposable  balance  of  105,812/.  The  directors  recommend,  a  divi- dend at  the  rate  of  Bs.  6d.  per  301.  stock,  or  at  the  rate  of  2/.  168.  84.  'per  cent.  per  annum,  which  will  absorb  105,310/.  and  leave  501/.  A  comparative  statement  of  passenger  traffic  shows  an  increase  in  the  receipts  of  2;7621.  on  the  main  line  and  branches,  of  1,2721.  on  the  Neith  Kent  line,  and  a  decrease  of  1,7981.  on  the  Greenwich  line,  as  compared  with  the  corresponding  period  of  1854.  The  inirease  in  the  goods  traffic  on  the  ,rnain  line  and  branches  amounted  to  3.4621.,  and  on  the  North  Kent  line  to  1.  7561.  ;  total,  5,2181.  The  revenue  account  shows  an  Increase  in  the  gross  receipts  fur  the  hal-year  of  7,8671.,  and  a  net  lucre  se  of  2,199/.  in  the  steam-boat  receipts  ;  making  together  10,066/.  The  profit  and  loss  account  exhibits  a  credit  balance  of  13,8871.  from  the  previous  half-year,  in- °wine' 8,842/.  which  had  been  paid  to  the  31st  of  January  on  account  of  the  costs  in  the  matter  of  the  Croydon  acchlent.  Mr.  Seymour  Clarke,  who  was  appointed  arbitrator  under  an  agreement  between  the  London,  Brighton,  and  South  Coast  Company  and  this  company,  having  .recently  awarded  that  85  per  cent.  of  the  damage  is  to  he  paid  by  the  Brighton  Company,  and  15  per  cent,  by  this  company,  'a  por- tion of  the  above  reserved  balance  accordingly  be- comes available  in  the  present  half-year.  The  profit  and  loss  account  also  shows  that  the  balance  -  of  net  re- eeipts from  traffic  for  the  half-year  (including  the  steam- boat receipts)  is  216  148/.  s-  against  2,24.772/.  in  the  corresponding  bait'  year  of  1854,  or  a  decrease  of  8,6231.  This  decrease  has  been  caused  principally  by  the  increase  in  the  expenses  of  the  locomotive  dui  artmeet  and  by  the  increased  rate  of  intereer  paid  on  borrowed  money.  Of'  the  total  increase  of  9.9561  in  the  expenses  of  the  loco- motive department,  4.3941.  has  arisen  from  the  increased  price  paid  for  coke,  and  the  remainder  from  the  costs  in- curred in  the  repairs  and  renewal  of  engines  and  tenders,  carriages  and  waggons.  The  increasei  aliount  paid  as  interest  on  loans  during  the  half-year  has  amounted  to  6.095/.  ;  and  there  has  also  been  a  ,,  increase  of  2,542/  in  the  dividend  payable  on  the  fixed  46  per  cent,  shares  issued  under  the  powers  of  the  Stro  ,  (d  and  Maidstone  Act,  which  is  required  by  the  erovieions  of  that  act  to  be  charged  against  rev  enu  e,  a  l  t  h  oug  h  th  e  li  ne  i  s  only  in  course  of  construction.  The  engineer  reports  that  these  works  are  proceeding  satisfactorily,  and  that  the  blanch  will  probably  he  and  ready  for  traffic  by  the  Ist  of  July  next,  when  the  capital  expended  on  this  line  will  become  productive,  instead  of  being,  as  it  now  is,  a  serhus  charge  upon  the  company's  revenue;  On  the  whole,  the  result  of  the  last  half-year's  working  of  the  railway  may  be  regarded  as  satisfactory.  The  increase  of  former  years  both  in  the  receipts  from  goods  and  pas  sengers  has  been  more  than  maintained,  notwithstanding  the  severity  of  the  past  winter  and  the  pressure  upon  tare  resources  of  the  country  caused  by  increased  taxation.

Aware,-furtherri.ore,  that  a  bill  has  just  received  the  sanction  of  Parliament,  which  embraces,  amongst  other  'objects,  the  of  the  Thames  :  But  taking  into  consideration  the  fact  that  the  board  of  works  (to  be  constituted  by  this  bill)  isnot  to  be  elected  till  next  January,  and  that  the  numerous  objects  to  which  its  attention  is  to  be  addressed  must  occupy  a  large  portion  of  its  time,  and,  consequenq,  that  theme  is  much  groand  for  apprehension  that  years  will  elapse  before  this  great  object—the  dispollution_  of  the  Thames  will  be  effected  :  We  beg  leave  to  record  our  cordial  concurrence  in  'your  'lordship's  design  of  holding  such  public  meeting;  and  seeing  that  the  metropolitan  commioio,ners  of  sewers  are  in  pots- , session  of  plans  and  money  which  may  be  forthwith  ren- (bored available,  we  submit  that  Amongst  other  resolutions  to  which  it  will  be  advisable  for  BArch  meeting  to  come,  will  be  one  appointing  a  committee  to  take  all  necessary  steps  for  watching  the  proceedings  that  may  be  taken,  with  the  view  of  securing  the  prompt  execution  of  such  works  as  may  be  finally  decided  upon.

St.  Cloud,  Angu4  22,  M.  5.  Sir.—The  Queen,  Prince  Albert,  the  Prince  of  Wales,  and  the  Princess  Royal,  arrived  on  the  19th  instant,  in  the  Victoria  and  yacht,  at  Boulogne,  where  her  Majesty  was  received  by  the  Emperor  of  the  French,  amidst  the  salutes  of  the  arniy  of  Boulogne,  posted  on  the  heights.  and  the  acclamations  of  a  vast  concourse  of  people  assembled  for  the  occasion.  At  Amiens,  where  the  Queen  stopped  for  a  Fhort  t  end  along  the  whole  line  of  ra.  I  way,  her  Majesty  was  re- ceived with  every  demonstration  of  respect  and  kind  feeling.  At  Paris,  from  the  station  to  St  Cloud,  these  feelings  were  manifested  in  the  strongest  manner;  and  I  can  con•  vey  no  better  idea  of  the  reception  of  her  Majesty  by  the  people  of  Paris  than  by  stating,  that  the  enthusiasm  was  quite  as  great  as  that  which  greeted  the  Emperor  and  Em- press on  their  arri'ial  in  London.  The  same  cordial  welcome  has  been  given  to  the  Q•men  at  the  various  places  where  her  Majesty  has  since  appeared  in  public;  and  her  Msj,stv  is  profoundly  sensible  of  the  spontaneous  and  universal  kindress  which  has  bgen  dis- played towards  her  by  the  people  of  France.  -  It  is  impossible  to  doubt  that  the  Queen's  visit  will  still  More  closely  cement  the  alliance  which  now  so  happily  subsists  batween  the  Sovereigns  and  the  people  of  Ei.gland  and  France.  •  •  I  cm  happy  to  inform  you  that  the  Queen,  Prinee  Albert,  the  Prince  of  Wales,  and  the  Princess  Royal  are  in  perfect  health.—l  have,  &amp;c.,  CGAR.

But,  although  the  absolute  power  of  the  --French  empire  resides  in  the  personal  will  of  the  Sovereign,  it  cannot  he  a  matter  of  indifference  when  &amp;Minister  who  has  served  that  power  with  fidelity  and  judgment  retires  from  its  service  on  a  question  of  policy  or  of  personal  susceptibility.  Both  these  causes  have  probably  contributed  to  the  resignation  of  Al.  Drouyn  de  I'Huys,  the  late  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs  in  France,  who  has  just  quitted  the  pOst  he  had  filled  for  nearly  three  years  with  considerable  ability  and  success.  The  talents  of  M.  Drouyn  de  l'Ffuys  may  have  been  over- rated, for  the  despatches  which  bore  his  name  and  extended  his  reputation  are  well  known  to  have  proceeded  from  the  pen  of  another  gentlem.sn  in  the  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs;  but  he  is  fairly  entitled  to  the  credit  of  straight- forward dealing  with  this  country,  and  to  the  honour  of  having  successfully  'established  the  diplomatic  relations  of  the  French  empire  with  the  rest  of  Europe.  It  was  his  singular  fortune  to  negOtiate  treaties  of  alliance  both  with  the  Crown  of  England  and  with  that  of  Austria  ;  and,  al- though he  was  engaged  in  transactions  which  have  led  to  .a  fierce  and  protracted  contest,  these  events  did  not  alter  the  moderation  of  his  opinions  or  the  prudence  of  his  cha- racter. But  in  the  office  over  which  he  presided  these  qualities  were  not  always  paramount,  and  the  personal  relations  of  the  Minister  with  those  who  participated  in  his  labours  were  cold,  jealous,  and  disagreeable.  M.  Thouvenel,  in  particular,  who  was  appointed  to  supply  his  :  plan)  during  the  mission  of  the  Minister  to  Vienna,  had  so  much  reason  to  resent  the  treatment  he  received  from  his  official  chief  that  he  placed  his  resignation  a  few  days  ago  in  the  hands  of  the  Emperor..  The!  resrlt,  however,  was  that  M.  Thouvenel  was  raised  to  a  far  higher  post  by  being  named  to  the  Embassy  at  Constantinople,  and  M.  Drouyn  de  l'fluys  withdrew  from  office  within  48  hours  after  his  return  to  Paris.  s  e  e  n  l  b  ;  remained  suppose  that  this  dispute  is  the  We  do  not,  howevec  i  ,.  aalnecraste,so6f  the  important  resignationa  crisis.o  f  the  n  sole,l,ore  Foreign  even  ia  i  t  a  li  ee  e  r  p  principal  c  F  r  h  s  p  e  e  a  p  k  r  i  o  n  a  g  e  e  o  d  f  a  M  d  M.  to  D  r  joinony  n  t  h  ci  e  e  Lhuys'  cou  f  e  e  v  n  i  a  s  e  i  t  a  t  t  o  udon  ,  before  w  ere  marked  that  on  his  arrival  here  he:was  disposed  Vienna,3  take  a  lower  tone  than  the  British  Cabinet  were  disposed  to  adopt,  ut  o  n  u  ta  r  ii  nn  o  e  w  tdh  n  ea  teoGovernment.vuriseenuoaf  two  thiso  rhAtashrrmleoeonngy  days  a  a  s  o  ne  L  tui  o  bn  rd  sueeqd  J  u  o  ue  h  nn  n  t.  although  he  subsequently  assented  to  all  the  views  enter- taineditbruo to  the  departure  of  the  British  Plenipotentiary  M.  Drouyn  de  Lbuys  appears  to  have  discussed  and  arranged  with  Count  Buol  a  proposition  of  terms  of,  peace  widely  different  from  that  on  which  the  allied  courts  had  previously  agreed.  This  scheme,  what.  ver  it  may  be,  was  unhesitatingly  re- jected by  the  head  of  the  French  Go.erunient  as  soon  as  it  was  made  known  in  Paris,  and  the  British  Government  were  equally  satisfied  that  no  honourable  peace  could  be  concluded  on  such  a  basis,  for  the  effect  of  this  condition  was  barely  to  limit  the  naval  strength  of  Russia  in  the  Black  Sea  to  the  force  she  already  possessed  before  the  out- break of  the  present  hostilities.  M.  Drouyn  de  Lhuys  ap- pears to  have  thought  that  peace  might  have  been  procured  on  these  term.  ;  but,  as  this  was  not  the  opinion  of  the  'Government  which  he  served,  or  of  the  allied  Government  with  which  he  was  acting,  this  difference  of  policy  led  to  his  retirement  from  office  on  the  teradeation  of  his  Vienna  mission.  It  is  not  only  on  the  ground  of  the  inadequacy  of  these  terms  that  we  are  'satisfied  the  Western  Powers  could  not  with  honour  or  consistency  accept  them.  To  desist  from  the  war  without  having  succeeded  in  the  object  we  pro- posed to  attain  by  the  expedition  to  the  Crimea,  and  with- outlaying materially  lessened  the  power  and  pride  of  Russia,  would  simply  beto  increaseher  influence  throughout  the  East  and  the  central  States  of  Europe  andtolower  the  reputation  of  two  nations  which  have  hitherto  claimed  the  first  rank  in  military  and  naval  warfare.  To  that  result  the  people  of  Englaikl,  and  we  believe  that  we  may  add  the  people  of  France,  a  ye  not  prepared  to  submit  ;  such  a  peace  would  be  fatal  to  the  G  overnments  by  which  it  might  be  con  cluded,  for  it  would  be  judged  of,  not  so  much  by  the  terms  we  might  actually  obtain  from  Russia,  as  by  our  failure  to  enforce  those  con  ditions  which  have  been  solemnly  declared  to  be  essential  to  the  future  security  of  the  Ottoman  empire  an  :1  of  Europe.  Moreover,  in  sug- gesting these  terms  the  Cabinet  of  Vienna  does  not  appear  to  have  possessed  any  assurance  that  they  woull  be  ac- cepted by  that  of  St.  Petersbure,  and  the  allied  Powers  would  thus  have  seemed  to  sue  for  the  peace  Which  they  have  every  right  to  dictate.  Under  these  circumstances,  whatever  may  have  been  the  opinion  of  M.  Drouyu  de  l'Huys,  the  Emperor  of  the  French  and  the  Queen  of  England  had  no  alternative  but  to  reject  such  a  proposition  and  to  prosecute  the  war  until  fresh  overtures  are  made  by  the  submission  of  the  enemy.  This  incident  is  in  reality  no  more  than  the  epilogue  to  the  Conference  of  Vienna,  anti  it  disposes  of  the  last  illusion  which  that  negotiation  may  have  raised.  To  supply  the  place  of  the  late  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  the  choice  of  the  Emperor  of  the  French  has  st  once  fallmo  on  Count  Walewski,  who  has  for  several  years  filled  the  office  of  Ambassador  at  this  Court.  In  some  re- spects no  better  choice  could  at  this  time  be  made:  Count  Walewski  has  laboured  with  great  assiduity  ai  d  good  faith  to  promote  the  alliance  of  the  tw  o  Govern- ments ,  and  the  two  'nations;  he  is  intimately  ac- quainted with  the  political  views  of  the  British  Ministry;  and  he  has  uniformly  endeAroured  to  give  energy  to  the  prosecution  of  the  war.  But  it  is  not  im- possible that  this  change  may  produce  a  perceptible  effect  on  the  relations  of  France  with  sonic  of  tho  other  States  of  Europe,  and  that  the  policy  of  the  Empire  may  be  modified  by  the  loss  of  one  of  its  most  cautious  ad- visers. The  choice  of  the  Emperor  is  restricted  within  the  narrow  circle  of  the  immediate  adherents  of  the  Impe- rial family,  and  M.  Drouyn  de  I'Huys  had  an  independence  of  position  not  easily  0  be  supplied.  The  Embassy  of  London  also  becomes  vacant  by  this  change,  and  the  names  of  M.  de  Persigny.  'M.  de  Flahault,  and  M.  de  Rayneval  have  been  mentioned  for  this  appointment.  We  abstain,  however,  from  offering,  any  remarks  on  this  subject,  in  our  E  F  tu  r  p  en  er  c  o  h  r  C  of  a  t  b  h  i  e  ne  le  n  irch  7.  ignorancetwaikl  l  c  ;  le  i  ,  t  i  rceao  thatut  o  he  doubtedhbdiesecis  which  representative  that  tthh  ,  e  n  this  country  should  combine  the  highest  personal  distinction  with  great  poli- tical judgment  and  experience,  for  it  is  more  than  ever  necessary  to  our  success  that  the  strictest  confidence  and  union  should  regulate  the  councils  of  our  alliance  and  the  operations  of  our  arms.  (Front  the  Morning  Post  of  this  day.)  _  The  most  recent  advices  from  Paris  place  it  beyond  a  doubt•  that  the  Minister  for  For  ign  Affairs,  M.  Diouyn  de  iglus,  has  thought  it  incumbent  up  on  him  to  place  his  resignation  of  office  in  the  hands  of  the  Emperor,  and  that  it  has  ,  e  n  accepted  by  his  Majesty.  I  t  further  appea  '  rs  13  that  Count  Walowski  who  hastily  left  London  yesterday  morning,  is  to  succeed  to  the  vacant  portfolio.  The  resignation  of  M.  Drouyn  de  l'Huys  will  be  viewed  with  universal  regret,  for  in  the  most  difficult  and  arduous  circumstances  of  the  tangled  and  long  negotiations  which  have  resulted  from  the  Eastern  question,  he  had  won  infi- nite credit  and  alastink  fame;  and,  althoughit  is  wellknown  that  the  Emperor  himsel  f  p  ersonall  y  directs  the  policy  of  France,  and  sways  the  destinies  of  thegreat  nation  which  has.  a  ppointed  him  its  ruler,  it  v  ,  as  nevertheless  understood  that  man  of  M.  Drouyn  do  l'Huys  personal  poon  as  one  of  the  wealthiest  men  in  France,  of  his  known  pre- cedenta, of  his  grasp'of  Iliad  and  independence  of  t  hou  g  ht,  co  uld  not  hold  offic  e  without  eiercising  a  large  and  salu- tary influence  in  the  direction  of  those  affairs  of  which  we  have  so  frequently,  read  the  lucid  exposition  in  his  eloquent  and  famous  :cotes.  we  must  wait  for  explanation  of  the  circumstances  at- tendant upon  the  change  in  the  French  Ministry  from  the  official  columns  of  the  Moniteur,  but  at  the  same  time  it  may  be  well  to  observe  that  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  the  step  taken  by  M.  Drouyn  de  Lhuys  was  dictated,  in  great  measure,  by  motives  and  susceptibilities  the  result  of  personal  views  in  connection  with  his  recent  mission  to  Vienna.  Lord  J.  Russell  fully  expressed  the  position  of  affairs  at  Vienna  on  the  adjournment  of  the  Conferences,  when  he  said  the  other  day  in  the  house,  that  the  plenipotentiaries  had  exha  usted  their  that  is,  they  had  fully  proposed,  and  had  recei  v  e  d  co  mplete  rejec  tion  of,  the  posi- tive and  ultimate  terms  agreed  upon  in  London,  when  the  French  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs  paid  a  flying  visit  to  this  country  ,  for  the  purpose  of  finally  and  precisely  ad  7  j  us  ting  our  demands,  before  he  proceeded  iu  person  to  pro- secute them  at  Vienna.  The  Conferences  having  at  length  been  adjourned  sine  die,  in  consequence  of  the  rejection  of  our  prepositions,  and  o  ur  refusal  even  to  discuss  the  absurd  pro  p  osals  of  Russia  ;  th  ere  were,  neverthe  less,  it  is  notorious,  several  attem  p  ts  point,  which  is,  af  t  e  r  all,  the  most  vital  matter  in  dis  p  ute.  It  is  believed,  whe  ther  correctly  remains  to  be  seen,  that  made  at  methods  f  of  a  new  proposi  tion  started  by  Austria,  the  French  Mi- nister gave  an  adhe  sion  so  complete  that  he  even  corn- refshi a  p  t  r  a  o  r  p  p  o  r  s  e  i  t  t  i  i  o  ,  i  g  n  s  ,  and  that  is,  at  fresh  modes  and  giving  force  to  the  third  m  isted  himself  to  procuring  its  acceptance  at  home;  but  if  this  were  so,  it  is  easy  to  comprehend  that,  if  the  new  proposition  did  not,  according  to  the  views  of  the  Allies,  interpret  and  give  force  to  the  third  point,  then  M.  Drouyu  de  Lhuys  must  have  placed  himself  in  a  false  position,  from  which  he  could  only  be  extricated  by  a  re- signation of  the  office  which  he  held.  If  this  be  the  case,  it  is  certainly  not  a  little  extraor- dinary that  so  distinguished  a  diplomatist  should  start  for  a  certain  place  with  the  most  definite  and  specific  deter- mination of  obtaining  one  thing,  and  should  allow  himself  to  be  betrayed  int  o  bringing  home  another.  For  the  explanation  of  all  this  we  must  wait  ;  but,  in  the  meantime,  it  is  certain  that  in  France  the  fall  of  a  Minister  does  not  indicate  a  change  of  policy,  and  it  would  be  most  erroneous  to  suppose,  on  the  one  hand,  that,  in  consequence  of  the  retirement  of  M.  Drouyn  tie  Lhuys,  France  is  less  ready  to  maintain  our  fit  m  alliance  and  to  carry  on  the  war  as  long  as  it  is  necessary  ;  or,  on  the  other,  that  the  French  Gove  rnment  is  one  'whit  less  dis- posed' than  ourselves  to  make  an  honourable  and  well- founded peace  whenever  so  desirable  a  consummation  may  be  attainable.  If  we  needed  further  proof  of  this  than  our  knowledge  of  the  consistent  poke-  of  the  Emperor,  w  e  m  i  g  h  t  d  er  i  ve  it  from  the  appointment  of  Count  Walewski  to  the  office  vacated  by  the  late  Minister.  His  intimate  relations  with  our  Government,  his  complete  knowledge  of  England,  and  the  active  part  he  has  borne  in  the  political  tranasactions  of  the  two  great  Western  Powers,  peculiarly  fit  him  for  the  high  post  to  ,  vhich  ,  it  would  appear,  'has  been  called,  and  to  succeed  the  distinguished  statesman  who  will,  personally,  be  as  much  regretted  in  Paris  as  Count  Walewski  will  be  in  London.

HARRISON'S  LEAMINGTON  KITCHENER,  _  _  _  Price  £l2.  Falkner-street,  Liverpool,  Sept.  13,  1855.  I  have  much  pleasure  in  testifying  to  the  admirable  perform- ance of  one  of  Harrison'  s  '  Leamington  Kitcheners  put  up  in  my  house  about  three  months  since.  •  I  have  found  it  perfect  in  all  its  arrangements  for  cooking.  Its  utility,  cleanliness,  and  freedom  from  all  smoke  and  dust  form  an  agreeable  contrast  to  stoves  formerly  in  use.  In  addition  to  this,  its  small  consumption  of  coal  must  in  a  short  time  save  its  entire  expense.  person  unaccustomed  to  its  use  would  scarcely  believe  its  capability  with  the  small  quantity  of  fuel  consumed.  skill  and  civility  of  Mr.  Harrison's  workmen  employed  in  its  erection  are  much  to  be  commended.  -  J.

E  HARDINGF,  Lietitenant  Colonel,  Coldstream  Guatds.  15,  Great  Stanhope-street,  April  25.  (Copy  No.  1.  15,  Great  Stanhope-street,  April  23.  dear  Wilson,—l  have  this  infant  read  a  speech  of  Mr.  Lay  aril's,  delivered  at  Liverpool,  in  which  ho  evidently  alludes  to  you,  introducing  my  name  in  the  following  manner  :  -  I  will  give  you  an  instance  of  a  friend  of  mine,  a  gentleman  who  served  throughout  all  those  bati  le.  and  dis- tinguished himself  most  signally.  He  carne  overto  is  coon- try sick  and  almost  dead.  There  were  two  men  above  him,  officers  in  one  of  the  Guards'  regiments,  who  had  never  left  England.  They  were  tnemb,rs  of  high  families,  and  they  were  promoted  without  purchase  ;  but  my  friend  was  a  poor  man,  and  they  ma  !e  him  pay  3,0001.  for  his  emu- mission ;  and  why?  Lord  Hardiege's  son  was  next  to  hill,  and  got  his  commission  without  purchase.  (Loud  cries  of  Shame  !  shame  !')  I  say  these  things  are  scandalous.'  You  are  evidently  the  friend  to  whom  Mr.  Layard  alludes,  and  I  am  more  openly  declared  to  be  the  officer  whop  as  the  son  of  the  Coutnamier-iu-Chief,  got  my  pro- motion for  nothing.  I  call  upon  you,  therefore,  as  an  officer  conversant  with  the  rules  of  the  service,  to  state  whether  the  trans- action can  bear  in  the  slightest  degree  the  colour  given  it  by  Mr.  Layard.  Your  decision  to  purchase  was  uninfluenced  by  any  but  what  appeared  your  best  interests  at  the  time,  and  did  not  affect  your  chance  of  obtaining  year  step  without  pur- chase by  the  accident  of  a  death  vacancy  ;  but  you  were  not  prepared,  like  Dawkins  and  Strong,  to  allow  a  junior  (in  their  case  Lord  Dunkelliu)  to  pass  over  your  head,  the  promotion  coming  in  the  usual  way.  Had  you  done  so,  I  should  have  paid  the  3,0001.,  taking  my  place  above  you  in  the  regiment,  and  you  would  have  succeeded  to  the  vacancy  caused  by  the  promotion  of  Co- lonel the  Hon.  A.  'Upton  to  be  a  Major-General.  mis-statement  of  Mr.  Layard  is  so  flagrant,  by  its  insinuations  as  well  as  by  the  perversion  of  its  facts,  that  I  know  you  could  not  have  been  a  party  to  it.  Be  so  good  as  to  give  me  an  early  answer,  as  you  know  that  my  ar- rangements are  made  to  return  to  the  Crimea.—Yours  truly,  A.  E.

This  method  does  not  require  the  extraction  of  roots,  or  any  painful  operation,  and  will  support  and  preserve  teeth  that  are  loose,  and  is  guaranteed  to  restore  articulation  and  mastication.

The  schooner  Elizabeth,  Captain  Price,  of  Newport,  40  days  from  Tarragona,  for  New•  castle,  put  into  the  Sound  yesterday.  About  10  dap  since  her  mate,  Mr.  Thos.  Phillips,  was  knocked  over.  board  by  the  spanker  boom,  and  drowned.  In  consequence  of  the'Soadinian  Government  having  discharged  9,000  men,  on  whose  services  they  have  .no  further  claim,  and  who  are  at  liberty  to  .enter  the  British  Italian  Legion,  this  force  will  before  long  be  complete.  Colonel  Hudson,  the  Inspector  of  the  Legion,  who  now  completing,  at  his  office  in  the  War  Department,  list  of  candidates  for  appointments,  is  still  in  want  of  row  good  English  subaltern  officers  who  can  speak  Ita.  Tian,  and  whose  colonels  will  vouch  for  their  knowledgl  of  their  duties  as  captains  of  companies.  Yesterday  500  i,rtisans,  handier:atm  -  nen,  and  navvies  very  carefully  sele6ted  for  the  duties  which  they  wi  have  to  discharge,  embarked  with  their  officers  on  boar'  the  Jura  steam  transport,  and  proceed  at  an  early  lioul  to-day  direct  to  the  Crimea.  They  form  a  portion  of  Sin  Joseph  Paxton's  Army  Work  Corps,  and  have  bee  organized  by  him  as  a  special  body  always  available  for  the  work  of  the  Commissariat,  hitherto  very  expen  sively  'and  ineffectively  performed  by  Croats  an(  other  labourers  hired  in  the  East.  They  will  not  b  placed  under  Mr.  Doyne,  but  will  have  a  chief  civi  lian  superintendent  of  their  own  in  Mr.  Wakefield  an  active  and  zealous  officer  of  the  Works  Corps,  whos(  experience  in  the  colonies  well  qualifies  him  to  fill  thei  situation.  The  formation  of  this  body  was  not  a  sow  gestion  of  the  borne  authorities,  but  originated  in  a  di-1  rect  application  from  the  C  om  missary.  General  at  thi  seat  of  war,  who  has  g  ,t  only  half  the  number  of  men  he  asked  for.  The  application  was  founded  on  the  benefil  which  the  Commissary  General  saw  other  department  of  the  army  deriving  from  the  Works  Corps,  and  is  satisfactory  testimony  to  the  usefulness  and  excellent  or  :  ganisation  of  the  navvies.  Not  more  than  five  week  have  elapsed  sin  c  e  Si  r  J  ose  ph  Paxton  received  the  ati4-  thority  to  form  this  body,  and  it  is  already  on  its  way  tAi  the  Crimea,  fully  equipped  and  provided  for  the  service  which  it  will  have  to  execute.  It  is  worthy  of  notice,'  also,  that  the  numbers  presenting  themselves  for  admisl  mion  into  the  corps  were  frequently  at  the  rate  of  1,00  a  day,  and  that  the  fellows  who  thus  presented  them  selves  are  not  lads,  but  stalwart  brawny  men  inured  tcl  labour,  and  each  capable  of  getting  through  more  work  than  ary  three  of  the  Croat  labourers  now  employed]  Such  is  the  estimate  of  their  value  made  by  the  Commis.;  ssry-General.  Their  wages,  therefore,  though  somewhat  above  the  scale  at  home,  present  a  large  economy  as  con'  trasted  with  the  cost  of  Turkish  labour,  and  the  greate  portion  of  the  amount  remains  in  this  country  for  th  support  of  the  men's  families  during  their  absence.  They  were  mustered  early  yesterday  morning  near  Sir  Joseph,  Paxton's  house  at  Sydenitam,  and  proceeded  thence  in  ay  body  by  railway  and  steamer  to  Deptford,  where  the  Jura  was  moored.  A  military  band  was  in  attendance  to  keep  up  their  spirit.,  which,  however,  appeared  to  require  little  stimulus  of  the  kind.  Sir  Joseph  aCCODI  panied  them  on  board  the  transport  to  see  that  every  airangement  bad  been  made  for  their  cmnfort  and  wel,  fare  on  the  passage.  Miss  Marsh,  who  has  acquired  much  influence  among  the  navvies  at  Sydenham,  was  also  present,  distributi  ng  re  li  g  i  ous  books  to  the  men  and  giving  each  a  word  of  kindly  advice  at  parting.  The  experimental  iron  mortar  float  No.  1  of  that  seriesi  which  was  towed  down  to  Shoeburyness  from  Woolwich  a  few  days  ago  for  experiments,  returned  yesterday  morning.  Her  mortar  (an  ordinary  13-inch)  fired  3g  rounds  on  the  first  day's  t  r  i  a  l,  an  d  ou  Tuesday  the  proof  was  continued.  It  was  intended  to  have  tested  -  this  newly-  constructed  mortar-vessel  to  the  extent  of  300  rounds  with  the  ordinary  charge,  when,  at  the  66`.1  discharge  on  the  second  day,  the  mortar  split  in  equal  divisions,  in  precisely  T  o  f  h  t  e  h  oae  m  portions,titself  a  has  e  m  however,sustainedann  er  being  a  s  n  t  lm  o  Beat  damage  carried  B  wbeyondbeab  rg  neither  of  nd  theteironle  bed.  i  r  coating  of  the  mortar  bed,  which,  at  the  first  concussion,  shrank  and  sprang  from  the  woodwork,  ripping  out  the  screws  with  irresistible  force  at  each  successive  explosion,  thereby  strengthening  the  opinion  of  the  superiority  of  a  wooden  framework  in  the  formation  of  the  mortar-bed.  The  annexed  circular  memorandum  had  been  issued,  directed  to  regiments  and  depots  at  home  and  abroad  :  Guards,  Dec.  14.  Commanding  officers  aro  requested  to  cause  all  per- sons intrusted  with  the  care  of  regimental  ammunition  to  be  strictly  enjoined  to  avoid  the  use  of  iron  hoops  or  iron  nails  in  the  heading  up  of  cartridge  barrels,  or  the  presence  of  iron  or  grit  amongst  the  percussion  caps,  car- tridges, or  loose  powder,  if  any  should  accumulate  from  broken  cartridges  taken  from  the  men's  pouches.  it  Th  e  use  of  iron  nails  in  lotening  on  cards  of  address,  when  ammunition  may  be  packed  for  return  into  store  conveyance  from  one  place  to  another,  is  al  so  t  o  b  e  s  t  r  i  c  tly  prohibited.  61  By  command.

A  VERY  COMMODIOUS  SMOKING  AND  NEWSROOM  ATTACHED•  BROMLEY'S  PATENT  EMPIRE  SOAP,  which  heretofore  has  been  difficult  to  be  obtained,  as  very  few  of  the  grocers  will  keep  it.  To  use  their  own  words,  by  way  of  explanation,  they  state,  Were  we  to  buy  it,  it  wo  uld  reduce  our  sales  fully  oue  third,  as  two  pounds  of  the  Empire  Soap  will  go  as  far  as  three  pounds  of  any  other  soap  ;  we  should  also  lose  our  profit  on  soda  and  washing  powders,.  as  neither  of  these  articles  are  required  when  the  Empire  Soap  is  used,  in  either  the  hardest  water  or  in  sea  What  the  grocers  are  displeased  at  in  this  soap  is  its  strongest  recommendation  to  the  notice  of  the  large  consumers,  private  families,  hotel  keepers,  laundresses  ,  &amp;c.  It  only  requires  to  be  used  with  a  light  hand.  And  besides  the  above  advantage  it  saves  half  the  usual  labour,  consequently  less  friction  and  wear  in  the  clothes,  and  will  not  injure  the  colours  in  the  most  delicate  prints  ;  and  is  equally  al  every  other  domestic  purpose,  even  for  toilet  use,  as  it  _  .a_nure  vli  s  able  for  e  soap,  free  from  rosin  and  other  useless  ingredients,  'dracolts,  detract  from  its  wnfich  not  only  add  unnecessary  weight  to  the  soap  cleansing  properties.

[The  following  appeared  in  our  third  edition  of  last  evening.]  _  _  This  morning  an  inquest  was  held  by  W.  Baker,  jun.,  Esq.,  deputy-coroner  for  the  eastern  division  of  Middle- sex, at  the  Old  Artillery-ground  Court  House,  Fort- street, Spitalfields,  on  the  body  of  Catherine  Lordon,  aged  45,  who  was  so  cruelly  murdered  yesterday  morn- ing by  her  husband,  Daniel  Lordon,  at  their  residence  15,  Parliament-court,  Artillery-passage,  Artillery-lane,  Bishopsgate-street.  The  jury  having  been  sworn  viewed  the  body.  On  their  return  the  first  witness  called  was  John  Davis,  residing  at  15,  Artillery-passage,  la- bourer. He  deposed  that  he  occupied  an  adjoining  room  in  the  same  house  with  the  deceased  and  her  hus- band, who  was  a  velvet  weaver.  Yesterday  morning  about  seven  o'clock,  as  he  was  lying  awake  in  bed  he  heard  screams  of  uttered  seven  or  eight  times  by  the  deceased,  and  proceeding  from  her  room,  and  her  husband  calling  her  opprobrious  epithets.  He  heard  the  deceased  open  the  door  and  run  down  stairs.  Witness  did  not  get  up,  because  it  was  a  frequent  practice  for  the  deceased  to  cry  murder  when  having  a  row  with  her  husband.  About  five  minutes  after  he  heard  a  person  leave  deceased's  room  and  go  down  stairs,  treading  heavily  like  the  footsteps  of  a  man,  when  he  heard  deceased  scream  Murder  three  times,  and  the  person  immediately  return  to  the  room.  Witness  dressed  himself  and  went  down  stairs  about  six  or  seven  minutes  after  he  heard  the  cries  of  murder,  and  saw  the  deceased  sitting  on  the  landing  in  a  crouching  posture.  He  ob- served blood  on  the  upper  landing  against  de  ceased's  door.  When  he  came  out  of  his  room,  deceased  when  he  saw  her  appeared  quite  dead.  There  was  a  great  quantity  of  blood  about  the  landing,  bannisters,  and  stairs,  and  also  on  her  clothes.  Witness  went  and  informed  his  fellow-servant  (Ellen  Leary,  residing  at  7,  Artillery-lane)  what  he  had  seen,  and  on  his  return  to  No.  15,  in  about  ten  minutes,  he  saw  a  doctor,  a  policeman,  and  the  husband  with  the  deceased.  Lordon  said  to  him,  Holloa,  Witness  said  to  him,  do  you  call  this  He  re- plied, don't  know  ;  it's  a  bad  Witness  said,  Yes  it  The  husband  appeared  as  if  he  had  been  drinking.  He  did  not  observe  deceased  was  wounded  until  Mr.  Shaw,  the  surgeon,  moved  her  head  on  one  side.  He  had  never  heard  the  husband  threaten  his  wife's  life.  They  both  drank  very  much,  and  he  had  interfered  on  more  than  one  occasion  to  separate  them  when  quarrelling  and  fighting.  By  the  Jury—There  were  persons  living  on  the  floor  where  he  found  the  deceased,  but  he  did  not  alarm  them.  Sarah  Elias,  wife  of  a  general  dealer,  resided  in  the  same  house  as  the  deceased.  She  occupied  the  first  floor  back,  and  did  not  hear  any  noise  yesterday  morning.  Had  she  heard  any  she  should  have  taken  no  notice  of  it,  it  being  such  a  frequent  occurrence  for  the  deceased  and  her  husband  to  quarrel.  About  half-past  seven  o'clock,  or  20  minutes  to  eight,  witness  came  out  of  her  room  and  found  deceased  sitting  on  the  top  stair  of  .the  first  flight  of  stairs,  with  her  elbow  on  her  lap,  supporting  her  face  with  her  bands.  She  saw  blood  about  half  a  yard  from  where  deceased  was  sitting.  Witness  passed  her,  went  downstairs,  and  returned  without  speaking  to  her.  About  five  minutes  after  her  attention  was  called  to  the  arrival  cf  a  policeman,  and  Mr.  Shaw,  surgeon,  and  then  it  was  she  knew  de- ceased was  dead.  She  heard  no  screams  of  murder  that  morning.  Witness  was  much  disturbed  about  2  o'clock  in  the  morning  by  the  deceased  and  her  husband  quar- relling in  the  street.  Deceased  was  apparently  tipsy  at  the  time.  Witness  did  not  speak  to  deceased  on  the  landing,  considering  she  was  in  liquor.  The  husband  was  generally  of  quiet  habits,  and  rarely  tipsy  ;  but  the  deceased  was  scarcely  sober  one  day  in  a  month,  and  quarrelled  with  everybody.  She  used  vile  language.  Witness  never  heard  him  call  her  other  than  dirty  blackguard,  you  have  been  drinking  Police  sergeant,  13  11,  Police  constable,  59  H,  and  Inspector  Marsh  gave  similar  testimony  to  that  before  Mr.  D'Eyncourt,  at  Worship-street,  yesterday  after- noon, and  reported  in  The  Sun.  Margaret  Lordon,  one  of  the  daughters  of  the  de- ceased, 18  years  of  age,  deposed  that,  in  accordance  with  her  mother's  directions,  she  slept  on  the  stairs.  She  went  at  10  o'clock  on  Monday  night  with  her  mo- ther to  a  raffle,  at  the  Green  Dragon,  Half  Moon-street,  Bishopsgate-street.  Her  father  was  there,  rather  in- toxicated, but  not  so  much  so  but  that  he  knew  what  he  was  about.  Two  of  her  mother's  brothers  were  also  there,  and  they  quarrelled  with  her  father,  and  one  of  them,  Daniel  Crease,  threatened  to  throw  him  down  stairs.  Daniel  Crease  pushed  her  father,  and  he  fell  over  the  stairs.  A  man  named  John  Kingstone  was  at  the  Green  Dragon,  but  no  quarrel  took  place  between  him  and  her  father.  About  one  o'clock  in  the  morning,  just  as  she  and  her  mother  got  home,  they  were  met  at  the  door  by  Kingstone.  Her  father  returned  home  about  half  an  hour  later,  and  saw  her  mother  standing  with  Kingstone  at  the  step  of  the  door.  On  coming  up  to  them  he  pushed  Kingstone  and  went  up  stairs,  leaving  her  mother  and  Kingstone  at  the  door.  Her  father  threw  something  out  of  the  window,  which  she  believed  struck  Kingstone  on  the  face,  after  which  he  came  down  with  a  poker  and  struck  Kingstone.  A  struggle  took  place  between  them.  He  then  went  up  stairs,  and  she  saw  no  more  of  her  father  that  night.  Witness  and  her  mother  slept  that  night  on  the  stairs,  being  afraid  to  go  to  her  father's  room.  Her  two  brothers,  aged  12  and  14,  slept  with  her  father.  They  were  called  by  her  mother,  who  knocked  at  the  door,  one  at  half-past  5,  and  the  other  at  6  o'clock,  and  left  to  go  to  their  work.  After  the  boys  had  left,  witness  and  her  mother  left  the  house  about  a  quarter  to  7  in  the  morning,  followed  by  her  father  to  Sandy's  row,  Bishopsgate-street,  but  she  did  not  hear  him  speak  to  either  of  them.  She  and  her  mother  walked  up  Bishopsgate-street  until  the  clock  struck  seven,  when  she  parted  with  her  mother  at  Whitegate-street,  which  was  the  last  time  she  saw  her  mother  alive.  Her  father  had  previously  gone  in  the  direction  towards  home.  When  she  parted  with  her  mother  she  turned  to  go  home  to  wash  herself.  She  said  she  felt  wretched  and  miserable.  Mother  was  per- fectly sober  yesterday  morning,  although  she  had  had  a  little  drink  over  night.  Witness  believed  her  father  was  jealous  of  Kingstone,  but  he  made  no  remark  to  him  when  he  pushed  him  aside  at  the  door  step  on  Monday  night.  Witness  on  her  return  home  about  10  o'clock  with  her  mother,  was  sent  by  Kingstone  for  a  pot  of  porter,  which  they  drank  at  the  door.  By  the  Jury—When  her  father  struck  Kingstone  with  the  poker  he  throw  him  down,  but  was  unable  to  take  the  poker  from  him.  Her  father  got  up  and  went  up  stairs  directly.  Kingstone  left  five  minutes  after,  at  the  request  of  deceased,  to  get  a  policeman  to  take  her  father  into  custody.  She  did  not  think  her  father  heard  what  her  mother  said.  The  knife  produced  by  the  policeman  was  identified  by  the  girl  as  belonging  to  her  father,  who  used  to  keep  it  in  his  chest  after  he  had  finished  his  day's  work  when  out  of  employment.  He  had  been  out  of  work  some  in  fa  c  tli  n  e  t  r  ler  l  -  a  s  s  t  t  ro  w  et  o  .  rked  sh  a  s  s  a  sa  l  w  abo  h  u  im  rer  on  at  s  th  n  e  nd  t  a  e  y  a  t  se  im  ar  e  ehou  li  se  er  night  last  put  the  knife  and  his  ticket  in  the  chest  close  by  the  bedstead.  By  the  Jury—Kingston  e  was  an  old  friend  of  her  father's,  and  he  had  frequently  brought  •  him  to  their  house.  Mr.  Henry  Shaw  (Shaw  and  Floyer),  of  Bishopsgate- ,wh and  was  stree  t  Without,  deposed  that  h  e  was  a  Lirg  called  on  Monday  mo  rning  to  visit  the  deceas  e  e  o  d  n  found  dead.  H  e  found  a  l  arge  pool  of  blood  i  whom  h  n  heral  lap  mo  ving  the  her  clothes  much  saturated  with  blood.  On  the  head  aside  h  e  saw  t  w  o  la  rge  wounds  on  the  neck  under  the  right  ea  r  ;  one  j  ust  abov  e  the  collar  bone  in  e  a  k  line  with  it  about  a  n  inch  and  a  half  long,  the  other  about  three  inches  an  d  a  half  lon  g  ,  a  nd  was  au  oblique  wound  extending  from  the  an  g  le  of  the  jaw  to  near  the  shoulder.  The  muscles  were  exposed  by  the  latter  wound.  He  put  his  finger  into  the  wounds  and  found  they  extended  to  the  vertebra,  near  the  collar  bone.  A  small  portion  of  the  vertebra)  was  chopped  or  broken,  showing  great  force  must  have  been  used  in  inflicting  the  wounds.  A  post  mortena  examination  of  the  body  showed  the  muscles  were  completely  divided  to  the  vertebra,  and  the  carotid  artery  half  cut  through.  The  point  of  the  knife  produced  was  slightly  turned,  as  if  from  coming  in  contact  with  the  bone  stated  to  be  chipped.  It  was  just  the  kind  of  instrument  he  should  have  suspected  the  wounds  were  inflicted  by  ;  groat  force  must  have  been  used.  Witness  found  the  lungs,  liver,  &amp;c.,  healthy,  and  ho  attributed  death  to  the  loss  of  blood.  He  thought,  from  the  pof-ibion  of  the  wounds,  they  were  inflicted  when  her  back  was  towards  the  party.  She  could  not  have  sur- vived the  injuries  two  minutes.  By  the  Jury—The  small  wound  was  not  sufficient  to  cause  death.  This  being  the  whole  of  the  evidence,  _  to  The  Deputy-Coroner  summed  up  the  evidencet  t  l  e.  the  jury,  remarking  that  in  addition  to  the  husband  ,  s  sta  ruents  there  was  sufficient  evidence  to  show  that  the  death  of  the  unfortunate  woman  was  caused  by  her  hus- band. Neither  drunkenness  nor  jealousy  was  a  sufficient  excuse  for  the  committal  of  such  a  crime  as  this,  and  it  would  be  for  the  jury  to  consider  what  state  of  mind  the  prisoner  was  in  when  he  committed  this  act  and  the  na- ture of  the  offence.  He  quoted  several  cases  where  death  had  resulted  from  wounds  inflicted  in  haste  re- ducing the  crime  from  murder  to  manslaughter,  pointing  out  their  bearin  g  on  this  case.  If  they  were  satisfied  it  was  a  premediated  act  they  would,  of  course,  return  a  verdict  of  murder.  The  jury,  aft  er  a  quarter  of  an  hour's  consultation,  returned  a  verdict  of  ‘  wilf  u  l  murder  against  Daniel  Lordon,  the  husband,  adding  th  a  t  h  e  C  ommitted  the  act  through  jealousy  and  drunkennese.

The  Earl  of  CLARENDON—My  lards,  I  feel  it  my  duty  to  ocumnaicate  to  your  lordships  the  cuteste  of  a  tele- graphic despatch  which  I  have  received,  &amp;heathen  aa  hoar  ego,  from  her  Majesty's  minister  at  the  Herta  It  is  se  follows  The  Emperor  Nicholas  died  this  laming  at  •  tee  o'clock,  of  pelmet:lc  apoplexy,  after  an  gnash  of  hale- I  also  received  from  her  Majesty's  minister  at  Berlin  a  despatch,  statist/  that  the  Emperor  of  Ramie  died  about  twelve  o'clock  this  day.  About  an  hour  before  this  despatch  arrived,  I  received  aseounts  from  Lord  John  Rumen,  at  Berlin,  stating  that  the  Emperor  was  at  the  point  of  death,  and  had  already  taken  leave  of  his  family.  My  lords,  I  apprehend  that  although  this  event  occurred  so  short  a  time  ago  as  between  twelve  and  one  this  morning,  there  cannot  be  thy  doubt  as  to  the  authenticity  of  this  information.  Under  these  circumstances,  and  as  this  tweapected  event  must  aecessuily  exercise  such  en  important  and  immediate  in- fusee upon  the  war,  upcn  the  negotiations  for  peace,  and  possibly  upon  the  policy  to  be  pursued  by  Freesia,  I  think  that  my  noble  sod  learned  friend  (Lord  Lyndhurst)  will  agree  the  it  might  be  attended  with  much  inconvenience  if  he  brings  forward  to-night  the  motion  of  which  he  has  given  notice.  I  trust,  therefore,  that  en  public  grounds  he  will  not  object  to  the  request  I  now  take  the  liberty  of  making  to  him,  sot  at  present  to  press  that  motion.  (Heir.)

But  I  beg  to  state  that  I  shall  not  withdraw  the  motion  of  which  I  have  given  notice,  but  merely  postpone  it.  Unless  I  find,  from  the  result  of  the  negotiations  which  are  now  said  to  be  going  on  at  Berlin,  that  the  Promise  mutt  otreades  .0  the  treaty  of  the  tad  December,  or  to  some  aqui- wheat treaty,  es  suggested  by  FfSllOlll  and  this  country,  I  shall  bring  the  question  forward  on  &amp;future  ocgoOort.

At  the  proper  time  the  whole  of  the  aereespesdeses  will  be  pro- duced; but  I  think  it  should  be  kit  to  the  geserenaist  to  Ss  that  time.  (lieu.)

Mr.  PEEL.  replied  that  the  rates  of  pay  sodsmod  to  wars  sot  those  which  attached  to  the  chaplaim*,  M  the  arm  serving  in  the  East.

UNDESCRETARY  FOR  THE  HOME  DERT- MEE-NT—ETHE AUSTRALIAN  COLONIES,  &amp;r.  In  reply  to  a  aeries  of  questions  put  by  Sir  J.  PAILINOTON,  Sir  G.  GREY  replica  that  ao  member  of  that  house  had  yet  been  appointed  to  succeed  his  hoe.  friend  (Mr.  Fiisroy)  in  the  office  of  Under-Secretary  for  the  Hume  Department  ;  and  by  law  no  nth  successor  could  at  present  be  appointed,  inasmuch  as  no  more  than  two  under-secretaries  could  sit  in  the  House  of  Commons  at  the  same  time.  Notice  had,  however,  been  given  to  introduce  a  bill  for  the  purpose  of  allowing  a  third  under-secretary  to  sit  in  the  house;  sad  if  that  bill  should  receive  the  sanction  of  parliament,  a  third  undersecretary  would  take  his  seat.

The  motion  for  the  adjournment  of  the  house  was  then  agreed  to.  TIM  ON  THE  ARMY  BEFORE  SEBASTOPOL.  On  the  order  of  the  day  for  the  consideration  of  the  report  of  the  committee  on  the  army  before  Sebastopol,  Mr.  ROEBUCK  rose  sad  said—l  rise  to  perform  what  is  to  me  a  disagreeable  duty,  namely,  to  propose  to  the  house  to  make  the  select  committee  appointed  to  inquire  lido  the  condition  of  the  army  before  Sebastopol  a  secret  con•  mittee.  It  is  to  me  a  dimmable  duty,  not  because  I  doubt  the  wisdom  of  the  cocoa.  I  propose,  but  bacon's  I  think  that  our  motives  in  taking  that  course  will  be  =is-  conceived  and  misspprehended.  As  I  find  that  then  is  already  Each  misconception  on  this  point,  I  will  explain  what  is  really  meant  by  a  secret  committee.  According  to  .  .  a  celebrated  formula,  ;here  were  beat°  us  three  eourw  We  might  have  made  the  committee  an  open  one,  so  that  there  would  have  been  admitted  the  public,  and  alto  mem- bers of  tbia  house.  &amp;madly,  we  might  have  excluded  the  public,  but  not  hats  ezeinded  members  of  this  house;  end  thirdly,  we  might  have  made  it  entirely  a  secret  committee.  The  committee  were  unanimous  in  their  opinion  that  secrecy  was  necessary,  but  s  to  the  mode  of  obtaining  that  secrecy  thus  was  a  difference  of  opinion.  Tne  majority  were  of  opinion  that  there  should  be  secrecy,  but  that  it  would  be  obtained  effectually  only  by  abutting  out  not  only  the  public  but  members  of  this  house.  Two  gen- tlemen of  the  committee  were  of  opinion  that  it  would  be  ,  better  to  shut  out  the  public  and  to  appeal  to  members  of  the  house,  and,  saying  that  secrecy  was  n  y,  ask  that  no  m  mber  of  the  house  should  break  in  on  that  secrecy.  The  majority  of  the  committee  thought  that  would  not  is  a  con- venient course,  and  that  it  would  be  best  to  appeal  I.  the  hoots  to  make  the  committee  a  secret  one.  But,  at  the  same  time,  there  is  no  fates- lion on  the  part  of  the  committee  that  there  shall  be  entire  secrecy  with  regard  to  their  proceedings;  and  when  the  evidence  has  been  given,  we  propose  to  make  such  a  selection  as  we  think  will  serve  the  public  interest,  and  publish  it.  Ia  making  this  appeal  to  the  house,  I  feel  that  the  committee  and  myself  are  appealing  to  the  house  to  have  confidence  in  us.  (Hear,  hear.)  The  house  has  entrusted  to  us  a  delicate  subject  of  inquiry,  and  we  wish  that  the  investigation  shall  be  not  only  complete,  but  one  that  will  be  safe  ler  the  usury  at  large.  (Hear,  hear.)  \l'e  felt  that  we  cannot  make  that  investigation  a  complete  and  searching  one  if  we  have  not  the  power  of  keeping  our  pro- ceedings secret  from  day  to  day.  If  we  do  not  pursue  that  course  from  day  to  day,  every  part  of  the  investigation  will  appear  in  the  public  papers  u  propounded,  and  by  that  means  accusations  against  individuals  will  go  forth  which,  although  they  might  be  answered  some  time  hence,  in  justice  to  thou  individuals  ought,  until  they  could  be  answered,  to  be  kept  secret.  (Hear,  hear.)  I  myself  thought  that  the  interests  of  individuals  ought  not  to  be  considered  if  the  public  interest  demanded  it.  But  there  is  a  greater  question  behind;  and  in  making  the  re- quest thati  am  making  to  the  house,  I  feel  this  difficulty,  namely,  that  the  very  reason  foe  asking  what  I  do  of  the  hones  almost  precludes  my  letting  the  house  know  that  reason,  (Hear,  hear.)  But  I  mill  shadow  forth  the  reason.  We  are  in  affiance  with  •  groat  power—(hear,  hear)—which  is  giving  us  every  as- sistance in  the  war  we  are  prosecuting.  To  maintain  that  alliance'  complete,  and  to  maintain  fully  the  understand- ing between  the  two  nations,  is,  I  mean,  the  wish  of  every  member  of  this  house.  (Hear,  hear.)  Bat  to  do  this,  and  at  the  same  time  to  give  to  every  man  brought  before  us  perfect  liberty  to  defend  himself  spinet  any  sensation  which  may  be  made  against  hiss,  in  any  manner  that  he  thinks  best,  would  be  found  impossible.  The  difficulty  that  pressed  on  us  aas  such,  that  we  bad  no  other  way  of  meet- ing it  than  by  throwing  ourselves  on  the  hour',  and  asking  the  house  to  have  oonfidenes  in  our  intentions  and  our  honesty  of  purpose  to  make  this  a  reel  inquiry  ;  not  to  blink  any  question,  but  at  the  suns  time  to  protect  the  interests  of  the  public.  (Hear,  hear.)  In  so  doing  we  felt  it  to  be  oar  duty  to  coins  to  the  house  ;  and  I,  as  the  humble  spokesman  of  the  committee,  throw  myself  and  the  COM- mitre* on  the  consideration  of  the  house.  I  say  that  you  have  delegated  to  us  a  difficult  and  •  delicate  task.  You  have  had  confidence  in  the  committee  to  which  you  have  entrusted  this  inquiry.  Have  farther  confidence  is  as.  De- pend oa  us  to  make  that  inquiry  complete,  and  depend  on  our  discretion  for  taking  what  we  think  the  want  clone.  I  find  spell  unable  to  'sprees  all  I  feel  with  regard  to  the  difficulties  of  the  task,  and  rocks  beset  my  path  on  every  side.  (Great  cheering.)  Still  lam  not  inclined  to  question  the  wisdom  of  the  house  is  appointing  the  com- mittee. The  good  we  have  done  is  already  manifested,  and  the  geod  we  shall  do  hereafter  will  be  fully  commensurate  to  the  difficulties  we  shall  have  to  encounter;  and  if  the  house  will  give  us  the  wenn  we  ask.  I  have  no  doubt  we  shall  be  able  to  fulfil  the  desire  of  the  house,  and  make  the  inquiry  complete,  and  to  propound  reforms  which  it  is  acknowledged  are  waisted,  and  which  will  be  greatly  for  the  benefit  of  the  community  at  large.  I  believe  we  shall  do  this,  if  the  hoses  gnat  us  the  power  we  ask.  I  therefore  beg  to  move  that  the  select  committee  for  inquiry  into  the  condition  of  the  army  before  Sebeatopol  be  a  secret  committee.  A  discussion,  which  extended  over  some  holm,  ensued.  Mr.  Roanoces  application  was  opposed  by,  amongst  others,  Lard  l33ntoua.  Mr.  W.  Parton,  Sir  J.  Gasman,  Mr.  S.  111111111  T,  and  Sir  B.  HALL.  On  the  other  hand,  Sir  J.  PAILINGTOPI  Slid  Kr.  LATAZD  insisted  that  BUM*  should  be  preened.  Lord  PALMBRSTON—I  will  shortly  state  the  grounds  why  lem  averse  to  the  motion.  When  first  this  motion  was  announced  yesterday  my  own  imprestions.were  etreugly  against  it,  bat  I  wished  to  hear  what  reasons  might  be  am- algamd for  the  MUM  it  was  latended  to  propose.  I  have  listened  with  great  attention  to  everything  that  has  paned  is  the  wane  of  this  dim-union,  and  I  em  bound  to  say  I  have  heard  nothing  which  in  any  degree  alters  the  opinion  I  at  first  sight  entertained  on  the  matter.  No  doubt  when  this  °amenities  was  Int  proposed,  I  frankly  stated  the  objections  which  have  been  urged  as  a  ground  for  making  it  a  ascent  committee.  I  felt  it  was  impossible  but  that  the  course  of  the  inquiry  would  tend  to  involve  us  In  matters  dangerous  to  the  relations  so  happily  subsisting  between  us  and  our  great  ally.  The  house  overruled  that  great  consideration.  It  was  stated  that  that  was  an  evil  that  might  arise  out  of  the  committee.  The  house,  nevertheless,  determined  that  the  lbgaby_sheedd  be  prosecuted.  In  my  own  opinion  it  is  net  dideallie  he  tenor  the  committee  with  any  intrude's'.

I  shall  respond  to  the  confidence  which  my  august  Sovereign  has  deigned  to  place  in  me,  if  I  succeed  in  drawing  still  closer  the  bonds  of  friendship  which  unite  France  to  Turkey.  The  Emperor,  Sire,  hoped  at  one  time  to  be  able  to  join  in  the  Crimea  that  valiant  army  whose  efforts,  united  to  those  of  the  Turkish  and  English  troops,  will  secure  the  triumph  of  the  most  just  of  causes.  In  aban- doning that  intention,  his  Majesty  made  a  painful  sacri- fice to  other  duties.  Neither  is  it  without  sincere  regret,  of  which  I  am  expressly  charged  to  be  the  organ,  that  the  Emperor  renounced  the  cordial  welcome  which  your  Ma- jesty proposed  to  give  him,  and  which  would  have  set  a  personal  seal  on  the  sentiments  of  the  two  sovereigns.  At  the  moment  of  commencing  my  mission,  Sire,  I  ven- ture to  make  an  appeal  to  the  kindness,  of  which  your  Majesty  has  deigned  to  give  me  marks  before  I  had  the  honour  of  being  known  to  you,  and  which  I  shall  employ  every  care  to  The  Presse  d'  Orient  of  Constantinople  has  letters  from  Kertch  of  the  22d  ult.

On  the  18th  part  of  the  garrison  of  the  Fort  St.  Paul  made  an  expedition  into  the  interior  of  the  country  as  far  as  Kop-Sarai-Nn,  six  leagues  from  the  town  and  one  league  from  Sultanocka,  where  a  small  Russian  corps  is  encamped.

To  Messrs  31oRtsorr,  British  College  of  Health,  New-road,  London  GENTLEMEN,—It  appear;  that  a  few  days  ago  several  noblemen  and  gentlemen  hal  as  interview  with  Lord  Paumure  on  the  subject  of  having  a  homoeopathic  hospital  at  Smyrna,  which  interview  has  been  the  cause  of  creating  war  to  the  knife  be•ween  the  gentlemen  of  the  guinea  trade.  In  the  last  Saturday,  the  whole  band  of  homCeopaths  are  denounced  as  quacks  of  the  vilest  die,  &amp;c.  This  is  a  pleasant  prospect  certainly  for  John  Bull.  Which  is  he  to  believe  ?  the  homoeopathic  or  allopathic  doctors  ?  Lord  Grosvenor  is  to  be  ousted  from  Middlesex,  and  I  don't  know  what  else—so  says  L'ancet.&#34;  Now,  I  appeal  to  the  country  wheth  rit  is  not  most  disgusting  to  see  these  doctors  continually  at  war  with  one  another  ;  and  all  for  what  Wby,  the  guinea  trade.  These  scientific  gentle- men, as  they  style  themselves,  are  all  fighting  about  who  shall  get  the  guineas  from  the  pocket  of  Jolot  Hull;  but  as  to  caring  a  rush  about  the  real  truth  iu  medicine,  such  a  thing  does  not  enter  their  heads  ;  for  surely,  otherwise,  we  should  not  seethe  unseemly  articles  which  they  level  at  one  another.  lam  no  friend  to  homoeopathy,  but  I  hope  Lord  Grosvenor  and  the  others  will  assert  their  right  on  this  question,  and  thus  vindicate  the  medical  liberty  of  the  subject,  which  is  a  right  inherent  in  every  free-born  Eng  ishman.  and  which  was  so  firmly  maintained  by  the  immortal  James  Morison,  the  Hygeist,  whose  system  will  yet  triumph  over  all  others!  for  it  is  emphatically  an  universal  system,  and  one  which  for  ever  abolishes  all  poisons  in  mediciw,  and  therefore  the  guinea  trade.  The  public  must  benefit  from  this  split  amongst  doctors.  Yours,  Br.c.,  A  HYGEIST.  London,  April  9,  1855.  • ",newspapers//0002194/1855/0413/0002194_18550413_mets.xml,advertisement

The  approaching  visit  of  the  Queen  of  England  suggests  to  the  .Pays  some  obser  va  ti  on  s  alike  marked  by  good  taste  and  j  ustice.

The  Pays,  in  bearing  the  fullest  testimony  to  the  excellent  feeling  which  prevails  in  Paris  on  the  subject,  makes  the  follow- ing observations  :  The  visit  of  the  Queen  of  the  United  Kingdom  of  Great  Britain  is  the  last  seal  affixed  to  the  alliance  of  the  two  nations.  In  this  point  of  view,  it  must  b  e  considered  as  an  event,  the  trace  of  which  will  remain  in  history.  The  enthusiastic  reception  which  awaits  her  Britannic  Majesty  will  be,  on  the  part  of  our  fellow.  citizens,  not  on  ly  an  ac  t  o  f  courtesy,  b  u  t  it  will  be  a  political  demon  s  t  ra  ti  on  .  All  th  e  mar  k  s  o  f  res  pect  which  the  French  people  will  lavish  on  the  august  ally  of  the  Emperor  will  be  justly  considered  as  a  fresh  and  striking  adhesion  given  to  the  policy  of  the  Anglo-French  al- liance. In  fOting  Queen  Victoria,  we  shall  celebrate  the  reconciliation  of  two  great  nations  that  have  ex- tinguished in  a  glorious  fraternity  of  arms  the  remem- brance of  old  discords,  the  seeds  of  which  are  for  ever  destroyed.  The  just  popularity  which  is  attached  to  the  person  of  Queen  Victoria  will,  besides,  be  expressed  in  such  a  manner  as  to  leave  no  doubt  in  her  Majesty's  mind  as  to  the  sentiments  which  she  inspires.  France  loves  and  respects  the  Sovereign  who  presides  with  so  much  wisdom  and  dignity  over  the  destinies  of  Eng  -  land,  and  who,  from  her  throne,  sets  an  example  of  every  virtue.  The  cause  of  the  sanguinary  quarrels  of  the  middle  ages  disappeared  with  feudality,  and  the  war  which,  at  the  beginning  of  the  present  century  ab- sorbed a  part  of  the  activity  of  the  first  Empire,  had  its  origin  in  the  political  situation  of  the  old  government,  prior  to  the  French  revolution.  Forty  years  of  uninter- rupted peace  between  France  and  England  have  effaced  the  last  bitterness  of  the  struggle  ;  a  new  generation  has  risen  up,  which  has  not  imbibed  the  milk  of  national  hatred.  The  moment  had  arrived  to  repair  by  the  cor- dial association  of  the  two  most  powerful  nations  of  Europe  the  mischief  which  their  enmity  had  caused  in  the  world.  This  great  idea  the  Emperor  Napoleon  and  Queen  Victoria  have  accmplished.  Thanks  be  to  them  for  it  !  Lord  Clarendon  said  the  other  day  in  the  House  of  Lords,  to  characterise  the  intimate  union  of  the  two  countries,  that  there  was  no  longer  either  a  French  or  an  English  Cabinet,  but  a  single  one,  the  members  of  which  sat  indifferently  at  one  or  the  other  side  of  the  Channel,  We  can  in  our  turn  say  that  there  will  be  only  one  people  from  the  day  when  Queen  Victoria  shall  have  made  her  entry  into  ELECTION  INTELLIGENCE.  KIDDERMINSTER.  The  election  for  this  borough,  occasioned  by  the  ap- pointment of  Mr.  Lowe  as  Vice-President  of  the  Board  of  Trade,  took  place  yesterday.  There  being  no  oppo- sitioß, Mr.  Lowe  was  declared  to  be  duly  elected. ",newspapers//0002194/1855/0815/0002194_18550815_mets.xml,article

ROYAL  LYCEUM  THEATRE.  THIS  EVENING,  and  every  evening  during  the  week,  the  GRAND  ELEUSINIAN  SPECTACLE  of  MAGIC  and  MYSTERY,  by  Professor  ANDERSON,  the  Great  Wizard  of  the  North,  in  12  acts,  with  ever-changing  variety  of  incidents,  continuous  surprises,  novel  and  extraordinary  effects.  Magic  and  Mystery  is  an  entirely  new  entertainment,  pos- sessing distinctive  characteristics  and  peculiar  phases  of  amusement.  It  is  not  a  monologue,  for  the  audience  them- selves perform  their  parts  with  the  principal  actor,  some  of  them  on  the  stage  and  others  in  front  ;  it  is  not  an  exhibition,  for  though  everything  becomes-  metamorphosed  before  the  eyes  of  the  visitors  no  one  can  be  positive  that  he  sees  any  one  thing;  but  it  is  a  comedy  really  performed  by  tho  com- pany ;  a  melodrama  replete  with  startling  positions  and  unex- pected denouements  ;  a  magnificent  spectacle,  with  2,000  of  the  public  every  night  to  appear  as  auxiliaries  ;  and  an  ex- travaganza, in  which  all  that  seems  to  be  is  entirely  beyond  the  bounds  of  probability.  Professor  Anderson  returns  his  thanks  to  thronged  and  fashionable  audiences  which  have  nightly  filled  the  Lyceum  Theatre  to  overflow,  and  by  means  of  whose  generous  aid  he  has  been  enabled  to  announce  Magic  and  Mystery  for  con- tinuous repetition.  He  believes  that  no  professor  of  his  art  has  at  any  time  or  in  any  place  been  honoured  with  an  amount  of  success  so  extensive,  so  decided,  and  so  unusual.  He  would  attribute  that  success  to  three  causes;  first,  that  in  his  present  entertainment  he  bee  placed  before  his  visitors  the  iesults  of  a  life  sedulously  devoted  to  the  attainment  of  perfected  skill  in  one  peculiar  art,  and  to  perfect  which  he  has  travelled  the  globe  in  every  clime  ;  secondly,  that  he  has  spared  no  trouble  nor  expense  to  put  this  entertainment  on  the  stage  in  the  most  elaborate  manner,  by  the  employment  of  the  first  mechanicians  and  artists  of  the  day  ;  and  thirdly,  'that,  while  endeavouring  to  provide  amusement  for  those  who  honour  him  with  their  presence,  he  has  not  forgotten  that  it  is  possible  to  afford  information  also,  and  that  the  oppor- tunity should  not  be  neglected  of  exposing  conjuring  wher- ever it  has  been  used  for  nefarious  purposes,  or  whenever  by  resorting  to  the  conjuror's  arts,  in  an  illegitimate  manner,  the  designing  have  succeeded  in  making  dupes  of  the  credulous.  The  937  letters  on  the  subject  of  spirit-rapping,  which  Pro- fessor Anderson  has  received,  from  the  time  of  opening  the  theatre  up  to  the  present  date,  bear  witness  to  the  great  in- terest taken  on  the  subject  of  this  singular  delusion  ;  whilst  many  of  them  bear  melancholy  evidence  to  the  dangers  which  '  attend  a  belief  in  the  superstitious  nonsense  of  the  Spiri- Judging  simply  by  the  correspondence  which  has  resulted,  Professor  Anderson's  exposé  of  spirit-rapping  and  his  illustration  of  the  so-called  table  phenomena,  have  pro- duced a  sensation  unequalled  by  any  previous  attempt  to  ex- pose a  mischievous  and  impudent  juggle.  It  is  impossible  for  Professor  Anderson  to  reply  at  length  to  a  tithe  of  the  communications  which  reach  him  on  the  subject.  Ho  regrets  that  many  of  these  should  come  from  ladies  and  gentlemen  who,  from  their  position  in  society  and  their  well-known  in- tellectual attainments,  he  would  least  have  expected  to  have  been  converts  to  a  belief  so  preposterous  in  itself,  and  so  easily  susceptible  of  being  controverted  and  disproved.  Every  evening,  from  the  Lyceum  stage,  Mr.  Anderson's  opinions  on  spirit-rapping  are  expressed,  and  every  evening,  within  Ur  ,  Lyceum,  how  tables  can  be  made  to  rap  is  exhibited  and  elucidated.  It  is  respectfully  requested  that  this  public  exposition  will  be  accepted  generally  as  Professor  Anderson's  only  mode'  of  replying  at  full  length  to  his  multitudinous  correspondents.  Ho  regrets  that  the  names  of  the  great  and  learned  of  the  land  should  have  been  made  to  figure  in  the  documents,  emanating  from  the  spirit-rappers,  as  for  instance  the  following,  ex- tracted from  the  Morning  Advertiser  of  Thursday,  Septem- ber 20,  and  taken  by  that  journal  from  the  New  York  Spiri- tual Telegraph.  It  purports  to  emanate  from  an  American  spirit-rapper,  Mr.  D.  D.  Hume  Sir  David  Brewster  frankly  confesses  that  ho  is  sorely  puzzled'  at  what  he  has  witnessed,  and  Lord  Brougham  acknowledges  himself  to  be  thoroughly  nonplussed.  Both  of  these  noted  men  brought  the  whole  force  of  their  keen  •  discernment  to  bear  upon  the  solution  of  the  phenomena;  but  the  presence  of  substantial,  actual  hands,  and  the  demonstrative  strength  of  the  spirits  who  thus  clothed  themselves  for  the  time,  and  moved  mate- rial objects  about  the  room,  proved  to  be  too  much  of  a  ques- tion for  them  to  Mr.  D.  D.  Hume,  the  author  of  the  above,  has  recently  left  England,  and  the  following  account  of  whe,  and  what  he  is,  occurs  in  the  Family  Herald,  No.  648:  This  young  man,  who  is  a  Scotchman  by  birth,  and  now  in  Italy,  is  a  remarkable  medium  for  all  the  manifestations  without  apparatus.  Barnum,  who  is  well-known  throughout  the  Anglo-Saxon  world  as  a  splendid  humbug,  offered  him  2,000  dollars  per  annum  if  be  would  perform  at  his  museum  in  New  York.  Barnum  then  took  it  for  granted  that  mediums  could  be  bought.  Ho  was  somewhat  astonished  when  his  offer  was  refused.  Hume,  on  telling  the  fact  in  London  lately,  simply  and  honestly  remarked,  that  the  money  would  have  been  very  acceptable  to  him,  for  he  was  poor,  young  (under  20),  an  or- phan, and  in  very  bad  health  :  but  he  would  have  been  afraid  of  losing  his  power  as  a  medium,  and  ho  would  sooner  lose  his  life.  The  refusal,  however,  made  Barnum  thoughtful.  He  inquired  into  the  subject.;  and  now  Barnum,  one  of  the  greatest  humbugs  in  the  world,  and  withal  a  conjuror,  is  one  of  the  firmest  „believers  in  It  is  cer- tainly surprising  to  find  such  a  paragraph  as  this  in  the  editorial  article  of  an  established  journal,  the  editor  of  whore  might  be  supposed  to  be  sane:  Even  if  Barnum  does  believe  in  spirit-rapping--  does  spirit-rapping  gain  or  lose  1:1)  this  accession  to  its  adherents?  and,  with  Barnum's  endorse  ment  to  it,  is  this  bill,  drawn  on  public  credulity,  more  likely  to  be  negotiated  ?  Professor  Anderson  would  believe  not  ;  but,  when  he  finds  that  educated  clergymen  of  the  Church  of  England  have  the  temerity  to  Subscribe  their  names  to  so  gross  a  swindle,  when  he  finds  that  the  Incumbent  of  Wortley  (the  Rev.  N.  J.  Godfrey)  positively  asserts  his  belief  in  it,  and  writes  a  book  on  the  subject,.  he  considers  it  to  be  time  for  bim  to  state  that  which  he  knows  of  the  mechanism  by  which  it  is  effected,  and  the  mischief  to  which  it  tends.  In  the  s  3,4orning  Advertiser  of  October  3  appears  a  letter  from  Sir  Dividd'Brewster,  relative  to  that  which  he  saw  at  Cox's  Hotel,  ill  company  with  Lord  Brougham.  He  distinctly  states  that  which  the  Wizard  of  the  North  proclaims  every  night—that  spirit-rapping  is  nothing  more  than  conjuring  applied  to  bad  purposes.  In  the  Morning  Advertiser  of  the  following  day.  however,  there  is  an  answer  to  Sir  David's  letter  from  one  who  was  present  when  he  and  Lord  Brougham  had  their  seance  with  the  spirits,  in  which  the  writer  says,  that  the  table  (a  large  dinner-table,  I  believe)  moved  about  in  the  most  extraordinary  manner,  and,  among  other  things,  a  large  ac.  cordion  was  conveyed  by  an  invisible  agency  to  my  hand  and  then  to  Lord  Brougham's,  which,  hold  by  his  lordship's  right  band,  apart  from  any  person,  it  played  an  air  through- With  such  a  statement,  printed  for  the  edification  of  the  people  of  the  19th  century,  with  the  facts  before  us  that  the  most  talented  men  of  the  day  are  permitting  themselves  to  be  deluded  by  these  juggling  spirit-mongers—that  the  greatest  novelist  of  the  age  is  now  engaged  in  making  it  the  subject  of  a  new  work,  and  that  a  spiritual  has  actually  been  advertised  to  be  hold  in  St.  Martin's-hall,  Professor  Anderson  trusts  that  his  exposures  of  the  spiritual- ists of  America,  as  given  by  him  nightly  at  the  Lyceum,  will  be  received  by  the  people  of  England  as  genuine  honest  at- tempts to  provide  an  antidote  for  the  bane  of  the  spiritual  jugglers.  In  the  course  of  the  last  five  weeks  100,017  persons  have  visited  the  Lyceum  Theatre,—a  larger  number,  it  is  believed,  than  has  ever  before  been  assembled  within  its  walls  in  so  short  a  period.

Me  proposed  to  reduce  the  amount  to  the  sum  of  3661.  Mr.  HADFIELD  supported  the  amendment,  and  con- sidered that  they  should  not  encourage  such  a  beggarly  sy,tem.  Mr.  KIRK,  as  an  Irish  Presbyterian,  could  not  sit  still  under  the  gross  imputations  that  had  been  cast  upon  the  persuasion  to  which  he  belonged.  They  rested  their  claim  on  a  positive  contract  entered  into  with  the  Crown,  and  which  had  been  perpetuated  from  the  year  1672  to  the  present  time.  The  opposition  was  raised  by  the  Society  for  tho  Liberation  of  Religion  from  State  Patronage  and  Control,  but  the  recipients  of  this  grant  had  always  re•  sisted  State  patronage  and  control.

Liv  t  iI  I  ITLLIEN,  in  making  the  above  announcement,  wishes  to  op,  e  attention  of  amateurs  of  music  to  the  great  difference  41Z  4  the  concerts  given  by  him,  with  an  immense  orchestra,  p  t  tler  l  ;  i  od  of  instrumental  celebrities,  brought  over  at  a  great  oce  from  every  part  of  Europe  (and  acknowledged  by  the  11,1  1  /  4  ,1d  profession  to  be  unequalled),  and  those  with  only  a  00,10qe  accompaniment,  or  an  orchestra  extemporised  for  044t0n;  and  at  the  same  time  to  the  striking  contrast  pre- in the  moderate  prices  of  admission  at  his  entertain- ' When  compared  with  those  of  other  musical  perform- sloo which  it  is  unnecessary  for  him  to  allude  further.  6'Mploying  twenty  years  of  his  professional  life  in  uniting  and  perfecting  such  an  assembly  of  artists  as  that  t  e  ,,  be  has  the  honour  to  direct,  for  the  execution  of  the  01  0  4  Pieces  of  orchestral  music,  M.  JULLIEN  has  been  no  less  6  to  elevate  the  vocal  department  of  his  concerts  to  the  v4r.,q  13,  standard  as  the  instrumental.  With  this  view  he  has  ‘  ,  4  the  exclusive  services  of  the  celebrated  Prima  Donna,  M  kDAME  GASSIER  olaa  Iy,  8  pursued  a  career  of  unexampled  suFcess  in  Spain  and  ri  t  has  Well  as  at  the  Imperial  Italian  Opera,  in  Paris--a  success  I‘)l  ,  ti  has  been  triumphantly  confirmed  in  .  the  ,  Metropolis  and  t  o  ,cea  of  Great  Britain.

Her  execution  has  been  acknowledged  by  Nt  lh  !lat  distinguished  musicians  and  professors  of  singing  to  be  f  te  Dassed.  17.0  te  ,  having  most  carefully  heard  Madame  Gassier  in  many  008  and  Operas,  M.

The  BEST  CONGOUS  arrived  of  this  Crop  are  of  the  KAISOW  kinds,  which  we  directed  public  attention  to  last  year.  The  MONINGS,  or  strong  full-bodied  Congous,  ARE  NOT  SO  FINE  as  previous  imports.  The  ZONING  districts  are  now  largely  occupied  by  the  Rebels,  and  this  may  account  why  the  FINEST  TEAS  OF  THE  SEASON  1854  are  now  only  finding  their  way  through  to  the  coast.  We  are  happy  to  inform  our  Customers  that  WE  HAVE  SECURED  SOME  OF  THESE.  They  are  REMARKABLY  FINE,  finer  than  any  we  have  hitherto  sold.  Congous  are  better  adapted  for  consumption  in  Liverpool,  on  account  of  the  HARDNESS  of  the  water.  But  where  SOFTER  water  is  attainable,  we  recommend  our  SOUCHONOS  and  OOLONGS,  whose  MELLOW  and  EXQUISITE  flavour  are  not  properly  extracted  by  hard  water.  To  give  our  Customers  an  opportunity  of  tasting  the  FINEST  of  the  new  Season's  Congou,  we  shall  sell  it  at  4s.  per  lb.  It  does  not  pay  us;  but  it  is  as  much  as  it  is  worth.  Our  FINE  OLD  MONINGS  AND  KAISOWS  we  sell  at  the  SAME  PRICE,  and  they  are  IMMEASURABLY  SUPERIOR.

Several  of  the  boys  excelled  greatly;  all  passed  very  praise- worthily.

F.  L.  H.  would  refer  to  the  following,  namely:—  _  __  Three-light  Gas  Chandelier,  to  slide,  without  fittings  los.

Every  description  of  Gas  Fittings  made  to  order,  and  Lamps,  Chandeliers,  &amp;c.,  Rebronzed  and  Relacquered,  by  first-rate  work- men, upon  the  premises.  AUREOLE  LAMPS.  The  arrivals  for  the  Season  have  just  been  received,  combining  every  variety,  from  the  Plainest  to  the  most  Ornamental,  and  all  at  the  most  moderate  prices,  namely  :  Complete,  with  the  best  mechanism  and  all  the  latest  improve- ments, with  Globe,  Chimney,  and  Cottons,  At  155.,  18s.  6d.,  255.,  285.,  to  .£25  each.  Every  description  of  LAMPS,  FOR  OIL  AND  CANDLES,  FOR  SHIP  USE  AND  DOMESTIC  PURPOSES.  A  large  Stock  of  PURE  COLZA  OIL,  IMPORTED  DIRECT  FROM  THE  CONTINENT,  kept  entirely  for  the  accommodation  of  F.  L.  H.'s  customers,  as  pure,  unadulterated  Oil  cannot  be  obtained  in  the  English  market.  The  Aureole  Lamp  having  entirely  superseded  the  Solar  Lamp  in  England,  F.  L.  H.  offers  his  remaining  Stock  of  SOLAR  LAMPS  to  Exporters  to  the  Colonies,  &amp;c.,  where  the  coarser  descriptions  of  Oil  only  can  be  obtained.  The  Lamps  will  be  offered  IN  LOTS,  FOR  SHIPMENT,  CONSIDERABLY  BELOW  THE  ACTUAL  COST,  and  all  the  Fittings  which  may  be  required,  at  Wholesale  Cost  Prices.  _  _  _  -  -  F.  L.  H.  takes  the  opportunity  of  stating,  that  those  Persons  who  may  hitherto  have  been  deterred  from  visiting  his  Establish- ment, by  its  great  extent  and  the  valuable  Collection  of  Goods,  are  not  aware  that,  by  overcoming  this  impression  (in  reality  a  prejudice),  the  result  would  be  most  advantageous  to  them,  as  they  would  find  that  they  could  purchase  Articles  of  a  better  qua- lity, and  at  Lower  Prices,  than  at  any  other  Establishment.  He  considers  it  almost  superfluous  to  add,  that,  whether  they  make  purchases  or  otherwise,  they  will,  in  every  case,  be  received  with  politeness  and  attention.  F.  L.

Iv  the  value  of  the  Public  Funds  be  taken  as  a  test  of  the  state  of  public  feeling  on  monetary  affairs,  the  week  has  been  characterised  by  quietude,  for  the  fluctuations  have  been  but  slight,  and  prices  have,  on  the  whole,  been  fairly  maintained.  This  quietude  may  be  partly  attributed  to  the  uncertainty  which  continues  to  prevail  as  to  the  turn  which  affairs  are  likely  to  take,  so  that  most  persons  are  deterred  from  speculating,  either  for  a  rise  or  for  a  fall  in  prices,  and  something  may  also  be  attributed  to  the  contradictory  influences  which  prevail.  On  the  one  hand,  the  speech  of  the  Premier  at  the  Lord  Mayor's  banquet  led  to  the  inference  of  a  continuance  of  the  war  ;  and  the  present  high  prices  of  foreign  and  colonial  produce  will,  no  doubt,  stimulate  increased  importation,  and  thereby  lead  to  a  demand  for  money.  On  the  other  hand,  advices  have  been  received  of  more  than  a  million  sterling  in  gold  being  daily  expected  from  Australia,  which,  in  the  absence  of  further  ,  demands  from  the  continent,  may  tend  to  lighten  the  pressure  upon  the  Bank  of  England  resources,  and  relieve  the  Money-market.  The  accounts  from  Australia  are  also  favourable  as  to  the  further  supplies  of  gold,  and,  as  in  a  short  time  we  may  anticipate  a  return  through  the  ordinary  trade  channels  of  the  large  quantities  of  specie  which  have  been  lately  sent  abroad  for  the  pur- poses of  the  war,  it  is  not  surprising  that  considerable  doubt  should  exist  as  to  the  state  of  monetary  resources  for  a  little  time  to  come.  We  have  recently  commented  at  some  length  on  the  injurious  influence  upon  mercantile  interests  of  the  Bank  Charter  Act,  which  has  been  not  inaptly  compared  to  a  man  being  compelled  to  wear  a  suit  of  clothes  which  were  made  for  him  when  a  boy.  Were  it  not  for  this,  there  would  be  nothing  in  the  state  of  commercial  affairs,  or  even  in  the  requirements  for  the  purposes  of  the  war,  to  excite  any  feeling  of  appre- hension ;  but  so  long  as  the  operations  of  the  mercan- tile community  are  fettered  by  restrictions  which  were  only  meant  to  apply  to  a  very  different  state  of  affairs,  there  exists  a  grievance  which  demands  the  serious  attention  of  the  legislature.  On  Wednesday  last,  the  Governors  of  the  Bank  of  England  had  an  interview  with  the  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer,  in  Downing-street,  and  it  is  rumoured  that  the  object  of  the  conference  was  to  authorise  the  Bank  of  England  to  increase  their  issue  on  securities  beyond  the  present  limit  of  fourteen  millions.  By  the  act  of  1844,  the  government  is  empowered  to  authorise  the  extension  of  the  issue  to  two-thirds  of  the  amount  of  the  issue  of  other  banks,  which  may  have  been  withdrawn  from  circulation  either  by  failure  or  the  substitution  of  Bank  ot  England  notes.  This  amounts  to  about  £700,000,  so  that  the  increase  will  come  to  something  under  half-a-million,  a  sum  far  too  little  to  have  any  sensible  effect.  The  Bank  returns,  published  on  Friday  last,  present  but  few  changes  of  importance.  There  is  a  decrease  in  the  stock  of  bullion  to  the  amount  of  £65,196,  but  as  there  is  also  a  decrease  in  the  circulation  to  the  extent  of  £333,765,  the  reserve  of  notes  unemployed  has  increased  £238,740,  so  that  the  total  is  £4,883,205;  a  margin  which,  in  the  face  of  expected  receipts  of  gold,  might  be  considered  ample  for  purposes  of  ac- commodation, without  imposing  such  heavy  rates  of  discount.  The  Bank  directors  may,  however,  have  over-reached  themselves,  for  the  returns  show  a  de- crease in  private  deposits  and  private  securities  of  upwards  of  a  million,  from  which  the  evident  inference  may  be  drawn  that  discounts  are  found  easier  else- where than  at  the  Bank  of  England.  In  the  considera- tion of  this  subject  it  must  always  be  rememberedthat  the  stock  of  bullion  in  the  Bank  is  by  no  means  a  safe  criterion  of  the  position  of  monetary  affairs.  An  excess  is  sometimes  caused  by  a  dulness  of  trade,  and  a  de- ficiency by  increased  activity,  as  well  as  by  demands  for  exportation.;  while  the  latter  may  be  influenced  by  a  fluctuation  in  the  state  of  exchanges,  which  may  be  merely  of  a  temporary  character  ;  and,  at  the  same  time,  it  must  not  be  forgotten  that  steam  navigation  offers  facilities  for  the  transmission  of  specie  which  were  not  possessed  during  the  last  war,  and  which  must  materially  influence  the  fluctuations  in  bullion,  as  far  as  our  foreign  trade  is  concerned,  as  the  cost  of  transmission  constitutes  an  important  element  in  the  question.  The  arrivals  of  specie  during  the  week  are  estimated  to  amount  to  about  £300,000,  and  it  is  computed  that  the  exports  are  fully  equal  to  that  amount.  Business  at  Manchester  has  been  tolerably  active  during  the  week,  the  demands  for  export  being  to  a  fair  extent  ;  and  prices  have  experienced  little  altera- tion, notwithstanding  the  commencement  of  a  strike  of  the  operatives,  which,  it  is  hoped,  may  be  averted  by  t  Woollen  doing,e  eoo  t  i  m  m  l  e  ed  l  na  y  na  tdrf  concessi  on  latec  s  prices  ss  o  e  f  an  n  the  are  tahfive  rei  partm  mastersef  theo  what  men.

In  t  e  h  s  e  s  Hosiery  and  Lace  trades,  though  no  improvement  can  be  noticed,  there  is  a  fair  extent  of  business  done,  at  previous  rates.  The  return  from  the  Bank  of  England  for  the  week  ending  the  17th  November  gives  the  following  results,  when  compared  with  the  previous  week  :  Public  Deposits  ...  £3,605,358;  Increase  ...  £235,374  Other  Deposits  ...  11,166,069;  Decrease  ...  628,131  Rest  ...  3,208,587;  Increase  ...  30,414  On  the  other  side  of  the  account  :  Government  Securities..  £10,124,848;  Decrease...  £76,428  Other  Securities  ......  17,879,564;  Decrease...  475,984  Notes  unemployed  ~....  4,883,205;  Increase  ...  238,740  ,The  amount  of  notes  in  circulation  is  £19,763,090,  being  a  decrease  of  £333,765,  and  the  stock  of  bullion  in  both  departments  is  £11,234,438,  showing  a  decrease  of  £65,196  when  compared  with  the  preceding  return.

Tas  egret  of  the  Money  Market  ham  at  length  become  so  serious  as  to  give  rise  to  general  anxiety.  Were  the  cossegnences  of  the  pressure  confined  to  the  total  extinction  of  all  speculative  tendencies,  they  would  be  comparatively  easy  to  be  borne,  even  in  a  great  commercial  community  like  ours,  where  many  of  the  operation;  are  neesesarily  prompted  by  sp.-  Gelation.  But  the  results  extend  farther  :  all  branches  of  trade,  even  the  very  soundest,  are  being  affected  by  the  dearness  of  money,  and  by  the  difficulty  of  obtaining  accommodation  sport  mercantile  bills  having  anycoosiderable  period  to  ran.  There  is  no  disguising  the  fact,  that  we  are  in  the  midst  of  a  monetary  pressuniof  greater  intensity  than  has  boon  witnessed  since  the  disastrous  autumn  of  1847;  and  it  is  beyond  a  doubt  that,  unless  some  amelioration  be  shortly  experienced,  the  commerce  of  the  country  will  be  considerably  restricted,  and  the  national  profits,  so  important  to  the  enoesadal  prosecution  of  the  great  contest  in  which  we  are  engaged,  will  be  sensibly  curtailed.  Within  the  brief  period  of  six  weeks—the  Bask  having  raised  Its  rate  of  discount  to  4  per  cent.  so  recently  as  the  6th  September—we  have  witnessed  a  rise  in  the  value  of  money  front  Si  to  8  and  even  7  per  cent.  During  this  remarkably  rapid  movement,  whilst  the  market  was  in  its  transi- tion stage,  we  judged  it  beet  to  do  oar  utmost  to  Local- este the  necessity  of  groat  caution.  With  this  view  we  have  almost  daily,  even  at  the  risk  of  reiteration  and  misconstruction,  enumerated  the  various  adverse  elements  affecting  the  market;  and  this  we  have  done  the  more  emphatically  because  hi  other  quarters  pertinacious  attempts  have  been  made  to  explain  away  the  cause'  of  anxiety,  and  to  lull  the  public  mind  into  false,  and  therefore  &amp;aprons,  security.  Experience  has  shown  that  the  period  of  transition,  when  a  sudden  contraction  of  trading  and  specula- tive engagements  is  neceesitated,  is  usually  one  of  great  danger;  and  thus  the  community  may  congra- tulate themselves  on  having  passed  through  so  cri- tical a  phase  without  sensible  embarrassment.  That  our  cautions  view  was  well  founded  is  fully  proved  by  the  result.  To  inlet  upon  caution  now  would  be  super- flume, tbeexisting  ratted  money  being  amply  enficient  to  enforce  extreme  circumspection  in  every  branch  of  trade.  A  great  step  has  thus  been  gained  towards  pre- venting aggravation  of  the  present  premiere,  and  esta- blishing a  foundation  for  future  recovery.  Instead  of  launching  out  into  fresh  operations,  merchants  throughout  the  kingdom  are  now  engaged  in  rigidly  restricting  them.  Regrettable  as  is  this  contraction  of  trade,  it  will  tend  to  render  accommodation  more  eery  of  attainment.  Under  present  circumstances  the  proems  is  necessary,  although  painful.  Fortified  by  the  stronger  basis  now  secured,  and  by  the  continucd  extraordinary  firmness  of  commercial  credit,  we  are  enabled  to  face  with  increased  confidence  the  adverse  influences  which  threaten  the  stability  of  our  mone- tary position.  These  dangers,  unfortunately,  ere  sufficiently  grave.  The  war  and  the  food  question  form  two  serious  elements  of  disturbance,  which  are  further  aggra- vated by  the  critical  position  of  monetary  affairs  in  France.  To  the  requirements  of  the  war  we  have  repeatedly  called  attention.  They  will  aoudads  be  heavy,  and  will  oared=  large  withdrawals  of  eoio.  Besides,  no  inconsiderable  proportion  of  the  sum  will  never  yield  say  direst  esters.  The  war  expendi- ture, though  unavoidable,  is  not  reproductive.  Never- theless, we  are  perfectly  satisfied  that,  were  our  position  is  other  respects  satisfactory,  the  bge- dens of  the  war  would  not  constitute  any  serious  brill  to  the  vest  resources  of  this  rich  country,  swelled  by  the  accumulations  of  a  forty  years'  peace.  Reverting  to  the  food  question,  we  see  cause  for  further  anxiety.  V  truth  can  be  most  nearly  attained  by  Weing  the  balance  of  opinion,  we  shell  be  led  to  this  einsississ  that  this  year's  harvest  in  Great  Brits%  her  been  Duke  of  Cambridge,  and  Hie  the  somewhat  below  the  average,  and  that,ocessquently,  R  oyal  Highness  Bate.

The  distressing  symptoms  which  accompany  this  com- plaint being  thus  dispersed,  the  sufferer  regains  buoyancy  of  spirits  and  a  completely  renovated  constitution.

KERTCH,  Nov.  26.—The  arrival  of  this  force  at  this  late  season  puts  an  end  to  the  slightest  chance  of  active  operations  this  year  on  their  part  against  the  enemy.  General  Vivian,  instead  of  heedlessly  wasting  most  precious  time  in  the  delicious  halls  and  bowers  of  the  Russian  summer  palace  on  the  banks  of  the  Bosphorus  during  the  summer  months,  now  comes  forth  with  his  men  to  ensconce  them  for  the  winter  in  the  Crimea.  Most  are  still  under  canvas.  &amp;low  -leas  set  in;  and  the  Turkish  Con- tingent will  be  housed  and  hutted  probably  next  January;.  In  the  meanwhile  sickness  and  the  in- clemency of  the  weather  will  do  its  work  of  deci- mation, far  greater  than  the  sword  of  the  hussar  or  the  lance  (4-the  cossack,  who  occasionally  show  in  the  neighbourhood.  Lieutenant-General  Vivian,  no  doubt,  while  Adjutant-General  of  the  Madras  Army,  was  most  efficient  at  the  red-tape  and  pen- and-paper business  ;  but  the  utter  waste  and  reck- lessness incurred  in  this  force  completely  place  his  capabilities  and  ideas  on  a  par  with  those  of  the  ancient  race  of  generals  of  1793,  who  led  their  men  to  disgrace  and  defeat.  No  wonder  that  robbery,  rape,  and  plhndering  of  all  description  have  become  the  order  of  the  day  in  Kertch  '  from  the  indecisi  on  an  d  w  i  s  h  on  th  e  par  t  of  the  Lieiitenant-Gener  a  l  to  soothe  a  few  old  Pashas,  by  overlooking  the  most  horrible  atrocities  ever  committed  by  the  hand  of  man  on  the  part  of  the  Osmanli  soldiers  now  beion,ging4  6  the  Turkish  Contingerit.  What  little  remained  of  Kertch,  from  its  first  sack  by  the  Allies,  once  one  of  the  most  beautiful  towns  in  the  universe,  is  now  a  scene  of  the  greatest  misery  and  desolation,  from  the  atrocious  and  villanous  excesses  of  every  description  by  the  troops  __.  ____.  under  Gen.  Vivian—the  roofs  and  flooring  of  the  best  houses  torn  up  and  burned  for  sheer  wanton- ness and  a  passion  for  destroying  property  which  ought  to  have  been  available  fora  future  slay.  The  arrival  from  Bnyukdere  of  a  fresh  supply  of  those  heroes  was  the  signal  for  a  fresh  display  of  the  same  conduct,  consisting  of  every  crime  in  the  calendar,  on  the  unfortunate  few  of  the  poor  resi- dents who  could  not  escape  with  their  more  fortu- nate neighbours  to  a  secure  place  of  safety.  A  minute  portion  of  some  of  their  soldier-like  propen- sities I  will  now  relate  for  the  edification  of  John  Bull,  who  has  the  gratification  of  raying  for  those  scoundrels.  A  few  evenings  hack  two  of  those  heroes,  a  cap- tain and  a  private,  attacked  a  small  house  occupied  by  two  old  ladies  above  60  years  of  age,  and  plun- dered them  of  all  the  money  and  valuables  they  possessed.  They  then  attempted  a  horrible  crime,  when,  an  alarm  being  given,  they  escaped  with  th  e  i  r  spoil.  The  next  day  the  fellows  came  again,  when  an  outcry  being  raised,  one  scoundrel  drew  his  sabre,  and  cut  ono  poor  woman's  head  asunder,  while  the  other  smashed  her  skull  with  a  huge  stone.  The  wretched  woman  being  released  from  her  misery  in  a  very  short  time,  the  fellows  made  towards  their  camp  as  if  nothing  occurred,  no  looker  on  daring  to  notice  it  for  fear  of  meeting  the  same  doom.  Those  murderers  belonged  to  a  regiment  of  the  Contingent  that.  arrived  only  a  few  days  back  from  Buyukdere,  and,  though  officially  reported  at  head- quarters to  the  Deputy  Adjutant-General,  Turkish  Contingent,  Lieut.-Colonel  (local)  Crewe,  a  captain  in  the  Madras  army,  no  notice  or  endeavours  what- ever were  taken  to  find  out  the  assassins,  though  this  gallant  officer  of  the  Madras  army,  who  never  saw  a  shot  fired  during  his  career,  if  lte  perceived  au  officer  out  of  regimentals  in  the  camp  or  street,  would  order  him  to  return  at  once  to  his  quarters,  under  pain  of  being  placed  in  arrest  and  reported  to  the  Lieut.-General  commanding,  making  a  fuss  perfectly  ridiculous  to  soldiers,  while  no  notice  is  taken  of  assassins  such  as  I  have  described.  It  is  well  known  that  the  wealthy  portion  of  the  Russians  inter  their  dead  with  their  rings  and  jewel- lery attached  to  their  persons,  and  it  was  brough  t  under  the  notice  of  the  authorities  that  the  graves  and  tombs  in  the  burial-grounds  were  exhumed  and  the  dead  bodies  exposed  to  every  indignity  by  the  atrocious  rapacity  of  the  Turkish  soldiers  re- _ _  cently  arrived.  A  small  picket  of  the  71st  High- land light  infantry,  a  corporal  and  six  men-250  of  whom  are  quartered  in  Kertch—were  patrolling  the  town  near  the  churchyard  the  same  evening  the  woman  was  murdered,  when  tTey  were  fired  upon  by  those  sacrilegious  vampires  ;  they  soon  re- turned the  fire,  a  yuz  bashi  on  the  spot  and  wounding  others.  N'ot  the  least  notice  was  taken  by  the  contingent  authorities  of  the  conduct  of  those  men,  unless  to  hush  the  affair,  if  possible,  from  becoming  public  ;  while  the  non-commissioned  officer  and  men  of  the  71st,  for  their  gallant  con- duct, were  thanked  in  regimental  orders.  The  morning  after  this  affair,  Reschid  Pacha,  who  com- manded a  brigade  of  Turks  previous  to  General  Vivian's  arrival,  had  the  consummate  impertinence  to  send  his  interpreter  with  a  written  order  to  Captain  Hope,  commanding  the  71st,  to  place  the  picket  in  close  arrest,  previous  to  their  being  tried  by  a  court-martial  for  shooting  one  of  his  officers.  The  gallant  captain,  th  e  moment  h  e  rea  d  th  e  order,  crumpled  it  up,  stating  to  the  interpreter  there  was  no  answer,  but  to  tell  the  Pacha  how  he  treated  his  orders,  and  would  continue  to  do  the  same  with  any  others  he  might  send  on  the  subject.  Peaceful  measures  with  these  demi-savages  will  never  teach  them  their  duty  towards  society—nothing,  I  am  convinced,  but  the  strong  iron  hand  of  military  discipline  held  over  them  will  ever  bring  them  to  order.  No  temporising  or  half-measures  of  mis- placed affected  feeling  towards  a  Turk  can  make  him  act  towards  you  in  any  other  way  than  a  half- suspicious feeling  that  you  have  some  design  to- wards him,  to  b  e  tt  er  yourse  lf  out  of  h  i  s  su  p  e  riority  as  a  human  bei  ng  —  a  f  e  ll  ow  li  tt  l  e  b  etter  in  intel- lect than  the  lar  ger  spec  i  es  o  f  a  b  a  b  oon,  a  s  far  .  as  '1  his  moral  or  hu  man  f  ee  li  ngs  go,  where  a  Ch  •  st=  is  concerned.  A  slight  commotion  was  caused  in  the  market- place of  Kertch  on  F  r  id  ay  l  ast.  Th  e  -  c  i  rcum  stances  are  as  follow  :—The  provost  marshal,  Major  Guernsey,  and  th  e  comman  d  ant  of  t  h  e  s  i  eg  e  de- fences Major  Hill,  R.A.  were  walking  in  the  neighbourhood  of  th  e  chief  pay-office  on  the  heights  of  Kertch,  the  former  looking  out,  as  was  his  duty,  for  squalls  —or,  vulgarly  speaking,  to  see  what  was  going  on,  in  the  vicinity  of  the  late  dreadful  mur- der. At  some  distance  ocf,  on  a  hill,  lie  espied  five  Turkish  soldier  s  susp  i  c  i  ous  l  y  wa  t  c  hi  n  g  a  house  belonging  to  an  old  man  ,  a  R  uss  i  an,  an  d  five  chil- dren ;  they  soon  ent  ere  d  ,  an  d  ,  as  usua  l  ,  knocking  down  th  e  man  an  d  c  hild  ren,  putting  them  in  fear  of  their  life  ;  then  plundering  became  the  order  of  the  day.  The  provost-marshal  coming  up  to  the  house  changed  the  scene.  Two  of  the  fel- lows, coming  out  of  the  gateway  laden  with  the  spoil,  immediately  dropped  it  and  bolted  ;  the  other  three  were  caught  in  a  trap  in  the  yard,  with  all  the  articles  they  could  carry  away  ;  two  of  them  escaped,  but  the  third  was  secured  by  the  provost- marshal, and  taken  to  the  guard,  where  he  re- ceived three  dozen  lashes,  which  he  most  richly  deserved,  amidst  a  commotion  of  Turkish  officers  and  soldiers,  of  all  descriptions  and  grades,  who  appeared  dreadfully  annoyed  that  this  person  was  not  allowed  to  go  free  as  they  wished—foras  toknock- ing down  an  old  man  and  children,  putting  aside  a  little  'outing,  in  their  eyes  constituted  no  crime.  However,  the  chief  leader  of  the  mob  outside  the  prison  was  a  captain  of  the  same  regiment,  the  7th  Turkish  Contingent,  quartered  at  Fort  Paul,  near  five  miles  off  from  where  the  delinquents  were  caught.  After  the  fellow  received  his  punishment  he  was  let  free,  when  an  attack  was  made  by  a  mob  of  over  three  hundred,  headed  by  the  above  officer  with  a  drawn  sword  ;  stone  throwing  and  other  missiles  were  vented  on  the  unfortunate  provost- ind as  his  revolver  out,  and,  covering  a  fello  w  that  nearly  cool  provost- marshal and  his  assistants  ,  who  were  knocked  down,  and  would  to  a  certainty  have  be  en  murdered  on  the  spot,  the  t,  if  saying  n  f  g  o  r  i  isn)  a  ers  a  m  ,  with  cu  c  presence  u  a  ber,had  not  pulled  broke  his  arm  with  a  stone,  shot  him  through  the  lungs—repeating  the  dose  to  two  other  indivi- duals, by  clipping  a  fellow's  ear  and  shooting  a  Turkish  soldier  through  the  neck,  which  nearly  settled  him.  The  valiant  heroes  soon  cleared  the  streets.  The  captain,  who  caused  the  row,  threw  himself  flat  on  the  ground  the  moment  he  saw  Major  Guernsey's  pistol  pointed  towards  him,  who  had  magnanimity  enough  not  to  shoot  the  scoun- drel as  he  lay  on  his  back  floundering  like  a  turtle  and  growling  for  mercy  ;  he  merely  took  his  sword  and  broke  it.  The  provost-marshal  was  wounded  in  the  head  and  his  arm  nearly  broken  ;  one  of  his  serjeants  was  cut  and  bruised  ;  a  corporal  of  the  71st  also  had  his  arm  severely  cut  from  a  sabre.  The  affray  was  witnessed  by  Major  Hill,  R.A.  Captain  Geo.  Swaby,  39  th  Regt.,  Major  F.  Miller,  BOth  Regt.,  and  Captain  Walker,  of  the  East  India  Company's  service,  who  all  deposed  before  a  court  of  inquiry  that,  but  for  the  coolness  and  intrepidity  of  that  officer,  all  the  Europeans  would  have  been  murdered  on  the  spot  to  a  moral  certainty.  He  only  acted  in  self.defence,  and  they  would  have  done  the  same.  Indeed  the  latter  officer,  riding  up  at  the  moment,  cut  down  a  Turk  with  his  sword,  while  in  the  act  of  felling  one  of  the  ser- jeants with  a  stone.  Now  what  follows  is  a  sad  reflection  on  giTing  unlimited  power  to  parties  not,  I  may  say,  having  P5_TB00127 NEW  CHRISTMAS  BOOK  BT  G.  P.  R  JAMES.  ESQ.

Among  the  of  the  metropolis,  the  Great  in  Leicester-square,  must  ever  hold  a  high  position,  not  only  because  of  its  unique- ness and  other  attractions  as  an  exhibition,  but  also  because  of  its  practical  utility  as  a  means  of  instruction  in  geographical  science.  Maps  and  globes,  undoubtedly,  are  to  be  had  in  abundance,  at  a  cost,  too,  which  places  them  within  the  reach  of  one  half  of  the  population,  and  comparatively  accurate,  as  many  of  them  are,  much  useful  infor- mation may  be  derived  from  them  ;  but  it  is  at  the  Great  Globe  alone,  constructed  as  it  is  on  an  extra- ordinary scale  of  magnitude,  that  a  full  appreci- ation.of the  relative  positions,  the  extent,  impor- tance, aspect,  and  peculiarities  of  every  country  in  the  world  can  be  obtained,  and  that  almost  at  a  glance.  It  is  not  surprising,  therefore,  that  the  spirited  proprietor,  Mr.  Wyld,  should  enjoy  a  large  share  of  public  patronage  and  support,  more  especially  when  his  constant  efforts  to  enhance  the  value  of  the  exhibition  are  taken  into  account.  With  what  judgment  these  are  carried  on,  a  visit  to  the  Great  Globe  at  the  present  time  will  suffi- ciently demonstrate.  As  we  all  know  the  war  in  which  this  country,  in  conjunction  with  her  gallant  Allies,  is  engaged,very  naturally  absorbs  in  a  large  degree  the  attention  of  the  public.  For  the  satis- faction of  this  general  curiosity  and  interest,  Mr.  1  Wyld,  it  will  be  seen,  has  liberally  and  successfully  ,  catered.  Any  one  desirous  of  information  in  rela- tion to  the  war  has  only  to  present  himself,  shilling  in  hand,  at  the  entrance  of  the  buildingin  Leicester- square, at  three  o'clock  in  the  afternoon,  or  half-past  eight  at  night,  to  have  his  wishes  gratified.  Having  ascended  the  staircase  in  the  interior  of  the  globe  he  will  have  the  main  particulars  pointed  out  and  explained  by  the  lecturer,tho  Rev.  Mr.  Brastead,  in  a  striking  and  lucid  manner.  A  pretty  accurate  no- tion will  thus  be  acquired  of  the  vast  extent  of  the  Russian  territories,  of  the  alleged  scope  and  danger  of  Muscovite  ambition--of  the  importance  of  Sebas- topol to  the  furtherance  of  its  aims,  and  of  the  value  to  us,  as  the  possessors  of  India,  and  to  Tur- key of  the  heroic  resistance  of  the  gallant  tribes  of  the  Caucasus  to  Russian  aggression.  The  lecture  over  the  visitor  will  be  conducted  to  the  spacious  room  containing  the  model  of  Sebastopol,  the  large  size  of  which  will  excite  his  admiration.  The  scale  en  which  it  is  constructed  is  nine  inches  to  the  mile  horizontally,  260  feet  to  the  inch  vertically,  and  including  an  area  of  200  square  miles.  An  inspec- tion of  the  interesting-spectacle  will,  with  the  lec- turer's assistance,  enable  him  fully  to  appreciate  the  nature  of  the  ground,  the  peculiarities  of  the  fortified  positions,  and  the  unprecedented  operations  in  which  the  Allied  armies  are  engaged.  To  the  north  he  will  observe  the  high  lands  on  which  the  fortifications  of  the  northern  side  of  the  harbour  are  erected  ;  to  the  south  the;cliffs  forming  the  bay  of  Balaklava  and  the  high  range  extend- ing to  Cape  St.  George  ;  to  the  east  the  high  grounds  rising  from  the  valley  of  the  river  Tcher- naya ;  to  the  west  the  high  cliffs  declining  to  the  low  lands  of  Cape  Chersonese  ;  and  in  the  centre  the  plateau  occupied  by  the  French  and  English  armies,  with  their  relative  and  divisional  positions  and  respr.ctire  approaches  distinctly  marked,  to- gether with  the  town,  harbour,  and  fortifications  !of  Sebastopol.  Th  o  l  ocus  i  n  quo  of  each  engage- ment in  the  Crimea  is  pointed  out  and  explana- tions given  by  the  lecturer,  so  as  to  enable  the  visitor  to  appreciate  the  peculiarities  of  the  actions  of  Balaklava  and  Inkerman.  Ills  curiosity  satisfied  as  to  geographical  and  scientific  matters,  lie  will  perceive  on  looking  round  the  room  a  variety  of  articles  captured  from  the  Russians  at  13oinarsund.  Conspicuous  among  these  is  a  beau- tiful statuette  of  the  Emperor  Nicholas,  said  to  be  a  pod  likeness,  a  rudely-finished  lady's  work-box,  a  clumsily-fashioned  lauthorn,  a  censer,  a  crimson  sacerdotal  vest  embroidered  with  gold  lace,  in- cluding a  cross  at  the  back,  several  coarse  military  cloth  and  sheepskin  coats,  the  latter  shaggy  and  otherwise.  Besides  these  ho  will  notice  a  variety  of  Russian  weapons,  Minis  and  Enfield  rifles,  shot  and  shell  (from  Woolwich),  and  models  of  fortifica- tions, gabious,  sand-ba  gs  ,  an  d  o  th  er  ma  tt  ers  eat- ployed in  the  siege  ;  together  with  the  War  or  a  large  collection  of  the  costumes  of  the  armies  of  Europe,  including  portraits  of  Lord  Raglan  and  other  generals  in  the  Crimea.  And  here,  if  ?  he  is  not  unreasonable,  our  friend  will  desist  for  this  visit  from  further  inspection  and  will  retire  homeward,  net  only  gratified  with  what  he  has  heard  and  seen,  but  also  determined  to  visit  the  Great  Globe  again,  and  bring  others  with  him.

This  circumstance  has  been  owing  to  the  fact  that  almost  every  available  steamer  has  been  employed  as  transports.

Tho  wounded  sailor's  story  is  a  bad  one,  and  was  told  in  a  simple  honest  manner,  but  the  police  sergeant  accused  dixelai  toed  striking  him  with  great  appearance  of  sincerity;  and,  looking  to  the  evidence,  we  think  Martin  may  have  fixed  on  the  wrong  man.  —  J.  T.  KING'S  CASE.  It  is  clear  that  Leach,  147  A,  had  a  boy  in  custody,  who  was  rescued  about  the  same  time  when  King  was  pushed  against  him.  Leach  may  have  attacked  and  struck  him,  under  the  impression  that  he  was  assisting  in  the  rescue.  Leach  gives  a  different  account  from  Charles  James,  and  describes  an  encounter  in  which  he  got  possesfion  of  two  sticks,  and  struck  a  lad  who  had  got  possession  of  his  trun- cheon. There  is  no  evidence  to  corroborate  Leach  as  to  the  encounter  he  speaks  of,  and  we  have  no  doubt  that  Leach  struck  the  complainant.  The  most  favourable  interpreta- tion is,  that  he  struck  King  supposing  him  to  have  been  engaged  in  the  rescue;  but  if  so,  he  struck  him  with  unne- cessary and  reckless  violence.  The  rescue  and  excitement  may  in  some  degree  palliate  this  offence;  but  Leach's  want  of  candour  and  misrepresentation  are  bad  features  in  the  Case.  B.  L.  SMITH'S  CASE.  Complaint  was  also  made  against  Charles  Leach,  147  A,  for  apprehending  Mr.  B.  L.  Smith,  a  barrister,  who  was  confined  all  night  in  one  of  the  cells  at  Vine-street  sta- tion. Originally  there  was  a  charge  made  by  Leach  against  Mr.  Smith,  the  hearing  of  which  the  magistrate  adjourned  for  a  week,  and  the  charge  was  ultimately  withdrawn  by  Leach,  but  under  what  circumstances,  or  why,  is  not  very  clear.  Leach,  however,  stated  on  oath  before  us  that  Mr.  Smith  assaulted  him,  and  that  his  conduct  was  riotous.  Mr.  Smith  did  not  appear  before  us,  and  no  evidence  was  given  to  affect  the  statement  of  Leach  on  this  point,  and  under  these  circumstances  we  cannot  hold  that  Leach  exceeded  his  duty  in  making  this  arrest.  R.  WOODWARD'S  CASE.  We  entertain  no  doubt  that  Woodward  was  struck  and  injured  by  some  policeman,  but  policeman  593  A  was  in  Westminster  Hospital  ill  of  typhus  fever  when  we  sat  to  take  evidence,  and  we  have  since  ascertained  that  he  died  in  the  hospital  on  the  10th  of  August.  G.  B.  COUCHES'S  CASE.  As  to  the  charge  against  policeman  229  A,  the  witness  Coukher  did  not  appear  when  229  A  was  produced  in  the  court  to  identify  him,  and  it  was  proved  by  this  policeman,  confirmed  by  the  testimony  of  his  landlord,  that  229  A  was  at  home  and  not  on  duty  on  the  Ist  of  July.  As  to  the  con- duct of  Superintendent  Martin,  we  consider  that  the  remo- val of  the  complainant  out  of  the  carriage  -way  was  proper,  and  that  the  superintendent  could  hardly  be  expected  to  dis- cuss the  point  under  the  pressure  of  duties  which  required  his  attention.  The  pmc3edings  to  remove  the  complain- ant were  rough,  but  if  he  would  not  quit  the  carriage-way  voluntarily  he  exposed  himself  to  some  degree  of  compul- sion, and  it  does  not  appear  that  he  was  hurt.  If  Mr.  Coulcher  bad  a  right  to  remain,  other  foot  passengers  had  also  a  right  to  remain  in  the  carriage  -way,  and  it  would  be  impossible  to  clear  it  for  carriages.  W.  STEPHENS'S  CASE.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the  savage  attack  on  Stephens  was  unjustifiable,  and  that  he  was  seriously  injured.  The  only  question  is  as  to  the  identity  of  the  policeman  81  C  as  a  party  concerned  in  the  attack.  Stephens  is  almost  certain  that  Charles  Madgett,  81  C,  is  the  wan  who  struck  him  on  the  mouth.  Nightingale  and  Humphries  both  swore  positively  as  to  identity  of  Madgett,  and  as  to  his  taking  part  in  the  violence  done  to  Stephens.  We  consider  that  there  is  sufficient  proof  that  Charles  Madgett  took  part  in  the  illegal  violence  in  this  case.  R.  F.  SANDALL'S  CASE.  Mr.  Sandall  does  not  speak  with  any  well  grounded  con- fidence as  to  Inspector  Lester  being  the  man  who  struck  him,  and  after  Lester's  denial  on  oath  it  would  be  wrong  to  hold  him  to  be  the  offender.  J.  STAPLES'S  CASE.  It  is  certain  the  policeman  was  not  the  man  of  whose  conduct  Mr.  Staples  complained.  Mr.  Staples  said  he  was  not  the  man,  though  it  is  difficult  to  account  for  his  mis- take in  taking  the  number.  T.  M'LEOWNAN'S  CASE.  Thomas  Prowse  did  not  appear  before  us;  if  he  had  come  forward  as  a  witness  this  case  might  have  been  cleared  of  doubt.  The  evidence,  as  It  stands,  is  conflicting,  and  we  do  not  consider  the  alleged  misconduct  and  improper  lan- guage to  be  proved  with  certainty  against  the  policeman  John  Bray.  H.  B.  MAXWELL'S  CASE.  Mr.  Mitchell  afterwards  stated  that  he  did  not  pre  ss  th  e  charge  against  this  policeman,  and  we  exonerat  e  p  o  li  ceman  345  A  from  this  charge,  but  there  is  no  doubt  unwarrant- able violence  was  used  towards  Mr.  Maxwell  by  some  po- liceman on  duty.  T.  CANNON'S  CASE.  The  witness  Cannon  was  maltreated,  but  his  evidence  is  insufficient  to  prove  who  was  the  offender.  The  Second  Class  of  these  cases  consists  of  those  in  which  witnesses  complained  of  misconduct  on  the  part  of  known  policemen;  but  the  persons  alleged  to  have  been  injured  or  aggrieved  were  not  examined  or  known.  CASE  OF  A  BOY  HURT.  The  policeman's  explanation  seems  satisfactory,  and  con- sistent with  the  witness  Blanchard's  evidence.  CASE  OF  A.  MAN  STRUCK.  If  the  time  of  the  transaction  in  question  had  been  dis- tinctly fixed  as  at  5  o'clock  ,  th  e  p  olice  man  375  A  would  took  place  about  6  o'clo  c  k.  Th  e  ge  which  make  s  it  pro- have disproved  the  charge  by  sh  owin  g  th  at  he  was  then  at  Vine-street,  but,  the  time  is  not  so  fixed  ;  and  Blanchard  mentions  that  10  minutes  after  the  transa  c  t  ion  he  saw  the  h  policemanb  that  w  t  i  h  t  e  h  t  a  ra  b  n  o  s  y  ac  i  t  n  iont  his  oo  c  injured  person  does  not  appear,  but  Blanchard  and  Berry  speak  so  distinctly  to  the  facts,  and  also  to  the  person  and  number  of  James  Teasdale,  that,  notwithstanding  his  de- nial, we  think  this  charge  of  violence  is  sufficiently  proved  against  him.  CASE  OP  A  BOY  KNOCKED  DOWN.  It  is  impossible  to  reconcile  the  account  which  this  wit- ness gives  with  his  guilt,  yet  the  witness  Daniel  took  down  the  number,  A  344,  at  the  time.  The  witness  Daniel  does  not  identify  the  person  of  the  policeman,  and  the  boy  stated  to  have  been  hurt  does  not  appear.  Under  these  circum- stances we  give  the  policeman  the  benefit  of  the  doubt.  CASE  OF  VIOLENCE  IN  THE  DRIVE.  The  young  gentleman  alleged  to  have  bees  ill-treated  does  not  appear.  The  facts  admit  of  the  explanation  given,  and  we  cannot  fix  blame  on  the  police,  who  were  engaged  in  clearing  the  carriage-way  at  the  time.  CASE  OF  THREATENING.  The  explanation  given  in  this  case  is  probably  correct;  :heroforo  we  see  no  reason  to  censure  the  policeman.  CASE  OF  ♦  MAN  STRUCK,  SUPPOSED  TO  BE  BINCROFT.  We  Ma  3  1  0  person  to  whom  Olives  evidence  ifs  appli•  cable  except  Bincroft,  and,  assuming  tiara,  he  was  the  per- son, we  think  the  policeman  has  answered  the  charge.  CASE  OF  VICLENCE  IN  PARK-STREET.  We  find  that  Vincent  Gummer,  police-sergeant  C,  acted  with  unjustifiable  violence  in  dispersing  the  crowd  in  Park-street.  In  a  number  of  other  cases  the  Commissioners  find  that  either  the  case  was  explained,  not  proved,  or  the  particular  policeman  not  identified  ;  and  as  regards  six  others  they  state—We  see  no  reason  to  doubt  that  in  all  there  cares  the  violence  spoken  to  was  committed  ;  and  in  the  absence  of  any  explanation  it  appears  to  have  been  wholly  unwar- ranted. After  full  inquiry  into  the  complaints  submitted  to  our  consideration,  we  have  deemed  it  our  duty  to  report  mis- conduct on  the  part  of  various  members  of  the  police  ;  a  result  the  more  to  be  regretted  on  account  of  the  high  character  of  that  body;  but  if  excesses  were  shown  to  have  been  committed  by  some,  ample  testimony  WAS  also  borne  to  the  moderation  and  forbearance  of  other  mem- bers of  the  same  body  on  the  same  occasion  '  •  and  what- ever blame  may  attach  to  indi  v  id  ua  l  s  ,  it  was  through  the  exertions  of  the  police  that  accidents  were  prevented  in  the  park,  and  property  in  that  vicinity  protected  from  damage.  When  the  events  of  the  day  are  properly  appreciated,  we  think  they  will  not  be  found  to  afford  any  ground  for  les- sening the  confidence  of  the  public—a  confidence  founded  on  the  experience  of  six-and-twenty  years—in  the  general  good  conduct  and  efficiency  of  the  Metropolitan  Police.  All  which  we  humbly  submit  to  your  Majesty's  most  gracious  consideration.  10th  November,  1855.  (L.  S.)  JAMES  STUART  WORTLEY.  (L.  S.)  ROBERT  BAYNES  ARMSTRONG.  (L.  S.)  GILBERT  HENDERSON.  COPY  OF  A  LETTER  TO  SIR  RICHARD  MAYNE,  K.C.8.,  COMMISSIONER  OF  POLICE  OF  THE  METROPOLIS.  Whitehall,  November  Li,  1855.  I  am  directed  by  Secretary  Sir  George  Grey  to  transmit  to  you  a  copy  of  the  Report  of  the  Commissioners  ap- pointed to  inquire  into  the  disturbance  of  the  public  peace  in  Hyde-park  on  Sunday,  the  Ist  July,  and  into  the  con- duct of  the  Metropolitan  Police  on  that  occasion.  This  Report,  which  was  delivered  to  Sir  George  Grey  on  the  10th  instant,  has  received  his  serious  attention.  From  the  description  given  by  the  Commissioners  of  the  nature  and  character  of  the  assemblage  in  the  park  on  the  day  in  question,  of  the  noisy  and  riotous  proceedings  which  took  place,  and  of  the  danger  caused  by  them  to  persons  in  carriages  and  on  horseback,  as  well  as  from  the  statement  of  the  Commissioners  that  the  crowd  contained  a  sprinkling  of  bad  and  dangerous  persons  who  required  the  control  of  the  police,  and  who,  but  for  such  control,  might  have  led  the  way  and  been  followed  by  the  thought- less and  inconsiderate  to  misAief  and  damage  to  property,  the  extent  of  which  would  only  ha  -  re  been  limited  by  the  resistance  they  met  with,  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  the  interference  of  the  police  was  indispensably  necessary  ;  and  Sir  George  Grey  is  happy  to  find  that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  Commissioners,  the  presence  and  acts  of  the  police  en  the  Ist  July  had  the  effect  of  preventing  any  such  result,  and  that  it  was  through  their  exertions  that  accidents  were  prevented  in  the  park,  and  property  in  that  vicinity  pro- tected from  damage.  It  is  a  l  so  sa  ti  s  f  ac  t  ory  t  o  k  now  t  h  a  t  there  was  no  evidnce  before  the  Commissioners  of  any  loss  of  life  or  bone  broken,  or  of  any  limb  seriously  hurt,  or  permanent  injury  of  any  kind  inflicted.  It  is,  however,  with  great  regret  that  Sir  George  Grey  finds  that  the  result  of  the  inquiry  has  been  to  establish,  in  the  opinion  of  the  Commissioners,  charges  of  serious  misconduct  on  the  part  of  some  members  of  the  force,  while  they  report  that  ample  testimony  was  borne  to  the  moderation  and  for- bearance of  other  members  of  the  body  on  the  same  occa- sion, and  that  when  the  events  of  the  day  are  properly  appreciated,  they  would  not,  in  their  judgment,  be  found  to  afford  any  just  grounds  for  lessening  the  confidence  of  the  public  in  the  general  good  conduct  and  efficiency  of  the  Metropolitan  Police.  This  high  character  which  the  force  has  acquired,  and  which  is  highly  creditable  ,to  it  as  a  body,  and  to  those  under  whose  immediate  directions  it  has  been  placed,  renders  it  the  more  important  that  every  precaution  should  be  taken  to  prevent  its  reputation  being  compromised  and  its  efficiency  impaired  by  misconduct  on  the  part  of  any  of  its  members.  With  this  view  lam  to  call  your  parti- cular attention  both  to  the  general  statements  of  miscon- duct contained  in  this  Report,  and  to  the  particular  in- stances in  which  the  Commissioners  have  recorded  their  opinion  that  such  misconduct  has  been  proved  against  in- dividual members  of  the  police  force.  The  latter  cases  are  not  numerous,  and  may  properly  be  dealt  with  in  the  first  instance.  The  first  to  which  Sir  George  Grey  feels  it  his  duty  to  advert  is,  the  case  of  Superintendent  Hughes,  who  was  charged  with  the  general  direction  of  the  police  in  Hyde- park on  the  Ist  July.  The  Commissioners  state  him  to  have  been  accused  of  undue  excitement,  of  using  impro- per language,  of  having  been  personally  guilty  of  many  as  •  sanits  with  his  horsewhip,  of  issuing  to  the  police  without  sufficient  grounds  orders  to  use  their  staves,  and  of  failing  to  control  many  excesses  on  the  part  of  the  police  under  his  command.  The  evidence  in  support  of  the  first  three  of  these  charges  was  insufficient.  to  satisfy  the  Commission- ers of  their  being  well  founded  ;  but  even  after  making  allowance  for  the  circumstances  in  which  ho  was  placed,  for  the  obstruction  of  the  road,  for  the  obstinacy  of  what  they  term  the  in  the  carriage-way  and  at  the  railings,  and  the  fact  of  stones  being  thrown  at  himself  and  Superintendent  Martin,  the  Commissioners  think  that  Superintendent  Hughes  was  not  warranted  in  the  order  he  gave  the  men  to  use  their  staves  at  the  time  that  order  was  given,  and  that,  although  if  the  use  of  the  staves  had  been  strictly  limited  to  the  clearance  of  the  carriage  -road,  they  might  have  considered  it  justifiable,  there  was  not  the  same  necessity  to  drive  the  crowd  from  the  railings,  and  still  less  to  clear  the  space  between  the  rails  and  the  water  of  the  Serpentine.  They  also  think  that  prudence  required  that  the  experiment  of  removing  and  keeping  back  the  crowd  from  the  rail  should  have  been  abandoned  immedi- ately the  collisions  attending  it  were  perceived.  The  Com- missioners further  advert  in  this  part  of  their  Report  to  the  conduct  of  parties  of  the  police  in  dispersing  at  a  late  hour  in  the  evening  groups  collected  at  a  distance  from  the  drive,  though  it  does  not  appear  that  any  riotous  or  other  illegal  proceedings  were  going  on  in  these  groups.  They  do  not,  however,  state  that  tlrse  parties  of  police  were  under  the  immediate  orders  of  Superintendent  Hughes.  The  opinion  of  the  Commissioners  with  regard  to  him,  on  a  review  of  all  facts  in  evidence,  is,  that  in  endeavour- ing to  discharge)  a  difficult  and  embarrassing  duty  he  gave  too  much  sanction  to  the  use  of  the  staves,  and  exercised  less  control  over  his  men  than  a  due  regard  for  the  safety  of  unoffending  individuals  required  ;  and  they  believe  that  by  a  more  calm  and  forbearing  course  on  his  part,  much  angry  excitement  at  the  time  and  complaint  afterwards  would  have  been  avoided.  It  is  right,  how- ever, to  notice  the  opinion  of  the  Commissioners  that,  to  remove  and  keep  the  people  back  at  some  distance  from  the  rails,  BO  that  the  noises  and  gestures  of  the  crowd  might  produce  less  effect,  was  the  measuie  most  likely  to  be  effectual  for  the  protection  of  persons  using  the  drive,  and  keeping  the  carriage-way  clear,  and  that  it  was  expressly  directed  by  you,  though  under  the  circumstances  detailed  in  the  report,  they  state  it  to  have  been  a  task  of  great  difficulty.  They  intimate,  moreover,  that  it  was  attempted  with  an  inadequate  force,  and  that  to  this  cause  is  to  be  attributed  much  of  the  violence  which  cannot  be  justified.  Sir  George  Grey  presumes  that  Superintendent  Hughes  was  not  responsible  for  the  amount  of  the  force  at  first  employed,  which  must  have  been  determined  by  the  Commissioners  of  Police,  and  that  the  strong  reinforcements  which  arrived  between  half-past  3  and  half-past  5  o'clock  were  sent  upon  his  application.  With  respect  to  the  order  for  the  use  of  the  staves,  Superintendent  Hughes  says  that  he  gave  it  on  his  own  responsibility,  and  that  he  gave  it  considering  that  the  critical  moment  was  come  when,  unless  controlled,  the  dangerous  elements  of  the  crowd  would  become  un- manageable, and  serious  mischief  ensue.  There  can  be  no  question  but  that  calmness  and  forbear- hfp the  a  theseu  factsb  position.l  i  public  o  peace,  t  qualitiesh  scar  and  s  owe  aus  that  lsdt  lance  are  as  essential  as  firm  ness  an  d  reso  l  ut  i  on  i  n  an  officer  placed  in  command  of  a  b  o  d  y  o  f  men  engaged  in  reserv- igmarkedraend e  ra  m  o  a  r  n  habitual  wholly  unfit  ab  for  e-  n  George  ata  Greyein  the  has  report,caref  ully  andth;  consi- dered opinion  of  the  Commi  ss  i  oners,  i  n  or  d  er  to  determ  i  ne  whe- ther n  cs:ab- sence :  ther  the  conduct  of  Superintendent  Hughes,  under  the  circumstances  in  which  he  was  placed  on  the  Ist  of  July,  was  such  as  to  disqualify  him  from  holding  the  office  of  a  Superintendent  of  Police.  After  taking  into  account  all  the  circumstances  as  detailed  by  the  Commissioners,  and  after  considering  the  long  service  of  Superintendent  Hughes  in  the  force,  and  the  general  approval  with  which  he  had  during  such  service  discharged  duties  requiring  great  judgment  and  discretion,  Sir  George  Grey  is  of  opi- nion that  while  it  is  necessary  t  o  mark  with  ()ensure  the  conduct  which  the  Commissioners  have  thought  justly  liable  to  blame,  his  dismissal  from  his  office  would  be  harsh  and  uncalled  for.  You  will  convey  to  him  the  disapproval  of  the  Secretary  of  State  of  his  want  of  forbearance  and  judgment  on  this  occasion,  and  enjoin  upon  him,  in  the  strongest  terms,  the  of  maintaining  perfect  self-control  in  the  highlyperform- responsible d  u  ti  es  ,  an  d  of  checking,  perfo  th  rm- ance bo  si  fy  ty  hhiiss  ex  example  and  his  orders,  any  unnecessary  vio- lence on  the  part  of  those  under  his  command.  In  connection  with  this  part  of  the  report,  I  am  to  direct  your  attention  to  the  recommendation  of  the  Commis- sioners, in  which  Sir  G.  Grey  entirely  concurs,  that  on  oc- casions similar  to  that  of  the  Ist  July,  a  superior  officer  of  the  police  ought  to  be  on  the  spot.  He  is  aware  that  this  course  has  been  adopted  on  the  occasions  on  which,  since  the  Ist  of  July,  the  attendance  of  large  numbers  of  police  has  been  required  for  the  preservation  of  the  peace,  and  it  is  obviously  one  which  ought  in  all  such  cases  to  be  taken.  Sir  G.  Grey  has  also  already  directed  you  to  ensure  on  all  such  occasions  the  presence  of  a  force  fully  adequate  for  the  duty  it  may  be  called  on  to  perform.  The  amount  of  force  requisite  for  any  particular  duty  must  be  decided  by  the  judgment  and  experience  of  the  Commissioners  of  Police.  But  it  is  obvious  that  the  presence  of  an  adequate  force  at  any  spot  which  is  likely  to  be  the  scene  of  tumult  or  disorder,  is  not  only  the  best  precaution  against  a  breach  of  the  public  peace,  but  the  surest  means  for  the  prompt  and  effectual  suppression  of  any  outbreak  which  may  oc- cur. He  is  happy  to  know  that  the  amount  of  force  em- ployed by  you,  and  the  measures  taken  for  its  distribution  and  employment  on  the  recant  occasions  on  which  the  ex- traordinary services  of  police  have  been  required,  have  been  such  as  completely  to  effect  the  object  in  view.  misconduct  specified  by  the  Commissioners  in  which  theirey  have  named  individual  constables  against  whom,  in  I  am  next  to  advert  to  the  particular  instances  h  of  judgment,  charges  of  such  misconduct  have  been  .  estab- lished. Sir  George  Grey  has  felt  some  difficulty  in  n  decid- ing ing  on  the  course  which  it  is  his  duty  to  take  h  •  •offence,  and  it  has  been  a  these,  amounts  to  an  indictable  matter  for  consideration  whether  indictments  shonl4l  not  •  t  all  of  these  policemen  for  their  alleged  be  preferred  against  cases.  The  misconduct  imputed  in  most,  if  not  in  all  of  illegal  conduct  ;  but  considering  the  length  of  time  which  llas  elapsed  between  the  occurrences  in  question  and  the  date  of  the  report,  the  probability  that  some  of  the  wit- nesses who  appeared  before  the  Commissioners  may  not  now  be  forthcoming,  and  the  fact  that  in  some  of  these  cases  the  persons  alleged  to  have  been  injured  or  aggrieved  were  not  known  or  ascertained,  it  appears  to  Sir  George  Grey  that  the  better  course  is  to  leave  the  majority  of  these  cases  to  be  dealt  with  upon  i  the  report  by  th  e  exer- cise of  the  power  vested  by  law  n  the  C  omm  i  ss  i  oners  of  Police.  The  cases  themselves  are  few  i  n  num  b  er,  and  Sir  George  Grey  is  of  opinion  that,  with  the  ex  ce  pti  ons  t  o  b  e  presently  mentioned,  the  ends  of  justice  and  the  object  with  which  the  inquiry  was  instituted,  can  be  satisftic- torily obtained  by  this  means.  The  policemen  against  whom  the  Commissioners  have  especially  reported  are  -  -  •  398  A,  since  ascertained  to  be  William  Gearing,  charged  with  the  apprehension,  without  sufficient  ground,  of  J.  J.  White,  and  of  inexcusable  violence  to  him  while  in  custody.  George  Thorpe,  363  A,  charged  with  the  unjustifiable  apprehension  of  Henry  Austin.  William  Bewlay,  20  D,  charged  with  unnecessary  violence  towards  Wiliiam  Floyd  and  James  Vassie.  Charles  Leach,  147  A,  charged  with  unnecessary  arid  reckless  violence  towards  John  Thomas  Kin...  Charles  Madgett,  84  C,  charged  with  taking  part  in  illegal  violence  against  William  Stephens.  amos  T!  19,  375  A,  and  Thomas  Wade,  385  A,  charged  with  violence  towards  persons  who  were  not  known  or  examined.  And  Sergeant  Vincent  Gurnmer,  21  C,  charged  with  unjustifiable  violence  in  dispersing  the  crowd  in  Park- street. Of  these  men  Sir  G.  Grey  is  informed  that  all  are  still  serving  in  the  police,  with  the  exception  of  Charles  Leach,  who  quitted  the  force  in  August  last,  and  is  therefore  no  longer  subject  to  the  authority  of  the  Commissioners  of  Police.  With  regard  to  all  these  cases,  with  the  excep- tion of  those  of  Wm.  Gearing,  Wm.  Bewlay,  and  Charles  Madgett,  lam  to  desire  that  you  will  take  into  considera- tion the  facts  stated  in  th  3  report,  as  affecting  each  of  the  policemen,  and  the  finding  of  the  Commissioners,  and  that  in  the  exercise  of  the  power  vested  in  you  by  law,  you  will  award  in  each  case  such  punishment,  either  by  suspension  or  dismissal,  as  3  on  shall  think  right,  having  regard  to  the  ordinary  course  adopted  by  the  Commissioners  in  the  case  of  constables  who  are  proved  to  have  committed  illegal  or  unjustifiable  acts  in  the  performance  of  their  duty.  In  the  three  cases,  however,  of  Gearing,  Bewlay,  and  bladgett,  the  acts  of  violence  deposed  to  before  the  Commissioners  appear  to  have  been  so  gross  and  unprovoked,  that  if  they  are  satisfactorily  proved,  the  mere  dismissal  from_  the  force  would  be  an  inadequate  punishment  for  the  offence;  and  as  the  description  of  the  witnesses  against  them  renders  it  probable  that  the  same  evidence  which  was  given  before  the  Commissioners  will  be  available  on  a  trial,  Sir  George  Grey  thinks  it  right  that  an  indictment  should  be  pre- ferred against  each  of  these  men.  Sir  George  Grey  has  not  included  Policeman  Joseph  Butcher,  109  .B,  in  the  list  of  those  against  whom  the  Commissioners  \  have  re- ported, because,  although  they  record  their  opinion  that  the  arrest  of  James  Bousted,  who  was  taken  into  custody  by  him  and  other  policemen  who  are  not  named,  was  not  warranted  by  anything  he  had  done,  the  constable  appears  to  have  acted  in  obedience  to  the  orders  of  Superintendent.  Hughes,  and  no  complaint  is  made  against  Butcher  per- sonally. The  apprehension,  moreover,  of  Bousted,  after  the  caution  he  is  said  to  have  received,  may  reasonably  be  supposed  to  have  been  sanctioned  by  your  written  order,  quoted  in  the  report  (p.  7)  directing  that  any  persons  shouting  or  making  any  noise,  or  acting  in  any  way  cal- culated to  cause  disturbance  or  frighten  horses,  were  to  be  cautioned  as  to  the  consequences  and  required  to  desist,  and  that  if  they  did  not  immediately  do  so  they  were  to  be  removed,  and,  if  necessary,  taken  into  custody.  In  addition  to  these  cases,  in  which  the  policemen  were  identified,  there  are  others  of  a  similar  character,  in  some  of  which  no  evidence  affecting  particular  constables  was  given,  while  in  others  the  evidence  of  identity  was  not  satisfactory.  Some  r  f  these  occurred  in  Hyde-park,  but  itr  Park-street  especially  the  Commissioners  state  that  there  were  several  cases  of  serious  injury  to  unoffending  individuAls,  which  proved  a  discreditable  exercise  of  vio- lence.. It  is  impossible  not  to  regret  that  persons  of  the  charac- ter described  by  the  Commissioners  should  have  been  mixed  up  with  a  crowd  such  as  that  which  is  stated  in  the  report  to  have  been  collected  in  Hyde-park,  and  at  a  later  hour  in  front  of  Lord  Robert  Grosvenor's  house  in  Park- street, as  it  cannot  be  always  easy  to  distinguish  between  persons  mingling  in  such  a  crowd  accidentally  or  without  any  bad  intention,  and  those  taking  a  part  in  its  illegal  proceedings.  The  Commissioners,  however,  have  not  been  unmindful  of  the  difficulties  with  which  the  police  had  to  contend.  In  Hyde-park  they  say  the  police  were  engaged  in  efforts  to  check  disorder  and  tumult  during  several  hours,  exposed  to  annoyance  and  insult,  and  often  obliged  to  act  under  circumstances  where  it  was  difficult  to  discover  the  exact  line  of  duty,  and  although  surrounded  by  a  vast  multitudethey  received  little  or  no  support  in  their  exertions  to  maintain  order.  The  Commissioners'  opinion  theriffore,  ou  the  several  cases  they  have  detailed  is  entitled  to  the  greater  weight,  as  having  been  formed  after  taking  all  circumstances  into  account,  and  I  am  to  direct  your  particular  attention  to  it,  and  to  desire  that  injunctions  may  be  given  to  all  the  officers  of  the  police  to  exercise  a  strict  control  over  their  men,  and  carefully  to  restrain  them  from  any  acts  of  needless  violence.  The  police  will  receive  the  full  support  of  the  Government  in  the  execution  of  the  important  duties  they  have  to  per- form, but  those  duties  can  only  be  usefully  or  efficiently  performed  by  a  cautious  abstinence  from  any  abuse  of  power,  and  from  all  acts  which,  if  not  strictly  illegal,  indi- cate a  want  of  the  temper  and  discretion  which  are  pecu- liarly requisite  in  persons  charged  with  the  preservation  of  the  public  peace,  and  which  Sir  George  Grey  is  happy  to  know  generally  characterise  the  Metropolitan  police.  I  have  now  to  turn  to  some  other  portions  of  the  report,  affecting  some  of  the  general  arrangements  connected  with  the  occurrences  of  the  lstiof  July.  The  first  relates  to  the  confinement  of  the  persons  taken  into  custody  at  the  Vine- street station.  The  remarks  of  the  Commissioners  on  the  defective  nature  of  the  arrangements  with  regard  to  the  numbers  sent  to  that  station,  and  the  inadequate  provi- sion made  for  their  accommodation,  appear  to  Sir  George  Grey-to  be  fully  warranted  by  the  facts  ;  and  although  he  has  been  informed  that  the  want  of  any  provision  for  send- ing a  portion  of  the  prisoners,  in  the  first  instance,  to  other  stations,  arose  from  the  number  having  greatly  exceeded  what  was  anticipated,  he  is  not  aware  of  any  satisfactory  reason  for  a  larger  number  not  having  been  removed  from  Vine-street  to  other  stations  after  the  insufficiency  of  the  accommodation  in  Vine-street  had  been  ascertained.  From  communications,  however,  which  he  has  had  with  you  since  these  occurrences  took  place,  he  is  glad  to  know  that  arrangements  have  been  made  by  your  directions  for  pre- venting, on  any  future  occasion,  the  recurrence  of  mis- management attended  with  such  serious  results.  Another  subject  very  properly  noticed  by  the  Commis- sioners is,  the  delay  in  bringing  the  persons  in  custody  before  the  magistrate.  The  utmost  diligence  ought  undoubtedly  to  be  used  in  taking  before  a  magistrate  persons  arrested  without  the  authority  of  a  warrant;  but  as  the  delay  in  this  instance  was  inquired  into  at  the  time,  and  its  cause  explained,  and  as  directions  have  been  given  which  will  prevent  the  occurrence  of  any  such  delay  o❑  any  future  occasion,  it  is  unnecessary  further  to  advert  to  it  here.  Sir  George  Grey  does  not  understand  the  Commissioners  to  impute  blame  in  any  quarter  owing  to  the  refusal  to  admit  the  prisoners  to  bail.  With  regard,  indeed,  to  those  charged  with  riot,  they  correctly  state  that  the  constable  at  the  station  was  not  authorised  by  law  to  take  bail,  and  that  you  could  not  properly  have  advised  him  to  trans- gress the  limit  of  his  legal  authority.  With  regard  to  the  others,  although  the  Commissioners  think  that  they  might  have  been  lawfully  admitted  to  bail  by  the  constable  in  charge  of  the  station,  if  application  for  that  purpose  had  been  made,  they  decline  to  censure  the  advice  given  not  to  exercise  the  power,  and  the  refusal  to  do  so,  and  they  alto- gether acquit  you  of  any  blame  for  not  having  personally  interfered  for  the  purpose  as  was  suggested.  There  is  one  other  remark  of  the  Commissioners  which  Sir  George  Grey  thinks  it  right  to  notice.  They  advert  to  the  difficulty  of  identifying  policemen,  and  they  give  the  statement  of  several  witnesses,  that  the  scroll  or  border  of  the  number  round  the  letter  on  the  coat  confused  their  sight,  and  was  a  great  impediment  in  ascertaining  the  number.  Sir  George  Grey  is  not  aware  that  any  better  means  of  identification  can  be  provided  than  the  use  of  the  numbers  and  divisional  letters,  but  these  ought  to  be  made  as  distinct  as  possible  ;  and  I  am  to  desire  that  you  will  consider  whether  any  alteration  can  be  made  in  the  man- ner of  affixing  these  numbers  and  letters  in  order  to  afford  greater  facility  for  prompt  and  easy  identification.—  I  am,'&amp;c.;  (Signed)  W.  MASSEY.  THE  ALLEGED  MURDER  OF  A  MILD  BY  ITS  MOTHER.  Yesterday  Mr.  Bedford,  coroner  for  the  city  of  West- minster, held  an  inquest  at  the  Prince  of  Orange,  Ro- chester row,  on  the  body  of  Wm.  G.  Allen,  age  1  six,  wlio  was  found  in  the  Thames,  near  Vauxhall-bridge,  on  Sunday  last,  under  circumstances  already  fully  reported  in  The  Sun.  In  addition  to  the  evidence  given  at  the  Westminster  Police-court.  John  M&amp;zey  deposed  that  he  met  Mrs.  Allen  and  the  three  children  on  Thursday  evening,  about  10  minutes  past  five.  The  mother  had  one  child  in  her  arms  and  one  on  each  side  of  her.  Mrs.  Allen  said  to  witni.ss,  is  very  and  went  on  towards  the  river.  She  spoke  rationally,  and  seemed  as  usual,  but  he  had  known  her  three  years,  and  she  always  appeared  to  have  something  on  her  mind.  John  Reynolds,  Waterman,  having  spoken  to  the  rescue  of  the  two  children,  by  him-elf  and  another  man,  said  that  the  children  might  have  fallen  into  the  river  from  the  pathway,  but  nit  %ery  easily.  There  were  railings  by  the  river  side.  They  might  all  11..ve  gone  down  the  steps  to  the  water,  as  the  gate  was  open,  but  they  could  not  thence  have  floated  to  where  he  found  them.  Groves,  55,  Thames  Police,  recalled—Thought  tho  children  might  have  fallen  through  the  railings,  and  floated  to  the  spot  where  two  of  them  were  rescued.  John  Goddy,  pierman  at  the  Cadogan  Pier,  picked  up  a  child,  aged  11  months,  under  circumstances  similar  to  the  above.  There  was  a  post  and  chain  along  the  path- way by  the  river  side.  Children  c3uld  get  under  it  pur- posely, but  not  accidentally.  The  Coroner  having  summed  up,  the  jury  without  hesitation  returned  a  verdict  of  drowned,  with- out evidence  to  show  how  deceased  came  into  the  Before  the  commencement  of  the  inquest,  it  was  men- tioned to  the  coroner  that  the  elder  of  the  two  children  rescued  from  a  watery  grave  had  sinne  the  exa  ,  ninatton  of  its  mother  at  the  Westminster  Police  Court,  on  Thurs- day, been  questioned  by  its  father,  in  the  presence  of  a  police  sergeant,  as  to  whether  it  fell  into  the  water,  and  that  it  had  answered  ;  mother  throw  me  in—- mother throw  me  As  the  mother  was  not  present  when  the  question  was  put  to  the  child,  the  coroner  de- clined to  allow  its  answer  to  be  put  before  the  jury,  but  probably  a  lull  statement  upon  this  point  will  be  made  today,  when  Mrs.  Allen  will  appear  at  the  Westminster  Police  Court  for  re-examination.

It  resulted  from  the  holetiou  if  the  Porte  moots  more  that  from  its  inferiority  am  the  ems.  Developed  by  the  Maumee  of  eireanistances  unconnected  with  Russia.  such  as  the  reguieration  of  Orem.,  the  battle  of  Nevariee,  the  conquest  of  Algeria  by  France,  the  lade  pendent  teedeneits  of  the  Pasha  of  Egypt,  of  the  Beys  of  Susie  sad  Tripoli,  which  deprived  the  Porte  of  sufficiently  important  maritime  amistaner,  that  inferiority  was  not  brought  on  by  Ramis.  It  had  famed  the  object  of  no  stipulation.  It  could  have  ceased  at  the  will  of  the  Porte.  The  topographical  coolguration  of  the  Bmphores,  so  fayouralte  to  the  orgsnisatioo  of  en  impregnable  system  of  defence  ;  the  possession  of  fortresses  cud  ports  such  as  Verse,  Sisepohe,  Bourget,  Trebisond,  ho.  ;  the  advantage  of  being  ab.•  to  veep  all  her  fortes  round  three  contiguous  baba—.  AOG  were,  and  they  still  are,  striking  advantages  which  the  Porte  possessed  sad  still  poseesees  over  Russia,  who,  obliged  to  maintain  aaval  forces  in  four  seas  separated  by  immense  detentes,  could  only  give  its  navy  in  the  Black  Sea  a  restricted  developmest.  soterithstaading  the  mistrust  which  for  twenty  years  pest  ass  been  excited  against  Russia,  the  Porte  shod.  not  maks  use  of  its  advantages,  would  it  not  be  bracer,  instead  dseeing  &amp;danger  for  benell  in  the  maritime  duet-anent  of  Ruses,  she  had  intuition  of  those  which  would  mama  !  her  el  sewhere,  and  spies%  which,  in  time  of  Deed,  the  lora.  of  Russia  might  se  •  morns  of  defence  ?  Morals,  es  well  as  materially,  fasts  seemed  to  justify  '  that  view.  People  have  strangely  deceived  themselves  in  he  the  dangers  to  which  the  Ottoman  empire  might  lis  on  posed  iron  the  Russian  fleet.  In  affirming  is  his  work  es  Southern  Russia,  that  with  bey  leer,  rated,  it  is  true,  at  30  vessel.,  Ramis  could  at  tub  oseupy  Constaatiaople,  Marshal  Minuet  has  committed  a  double  error,.  on  the  an,  head,  because  the  Russian  sae=  fumes  in  the  Black  Sea  can  never  reach  that  number  without  uniting  with  those  of  the  Beltic—s,  junction  which  is  Beaman'.  ;  on  the  other,  because  if  even  so  gigantic  •  maritime  development  could  be  effected,  it  would  be  very  fsr  from  leading  to  the  dangers  which  appear  to  be  appre- hended. That  which  is  now  passing  is  the  Crimea  would  be  sufficient  to  prove  this.  The  real  fasts  are,  indeed,  otherwise  opposed  to  these  hypotheses.  Let  us  take  for  Matinee  what  permed  in  1833.  At  that  epoch  toe  Ramis.  fleet  appears  in  the  B  aphides  and  eff-cte  a  descent,  but  ceder  what  ettuditious  ?  It  is  with  toe  consent  of  the  Salm,  and  to  come  to  his  aid.  Moreover,  seethes  itself  of  all  its  sftipoing,  the  Ramie'.  Seer  could  oily  transport  oat  that  =maim  from  10,000  to  12.000  men.  And  it  will  be  admitted  this  this  fora,  im- portant as  an  auxiliary,  would  have  been  entirely  insuill•  cleat  if  it  bed  presented  itself  as  an  enemy.  Sines  that  time  south  has  been  veil  of  the  develop- ment of  the  Ration  navy.  Notwithstanding  al  that  has  heel  mid,  what  do  we  m  lean  after,  e  twenty  yeater,  that  is  to  say,  in  18  63?  the  Raman  fleet  taken  about  fifteen  days  for  the  unbarke- tins, toe  transport,  eel  the  disembarkation  of  a  division  of  inleetry,  that  is  to  say,  frees  18,000  to  16,000  men,  from  Sebastopol  to  Relents  Kale.  On  taking  into  eonstrieratios  the  proximity  of  the  'Bul- b.. establishments  of  Russia,  20,000  men  at  most  can  be  reckoned  as  the  number  of  troops  far  descent  which  the  KRUM!  'Buy  of  the  Black  Sea,  is  its  greatest  develop  meet,  would  be  in  a  position  to  transport,  on  any  given  point  of  the  Ottoman  territory,  in  the  epees  of  about  three  weeks.  Is  that  a  very  great  drawer?  Does  it  justify  the  spore- bessions which  have  been  counived  ?  Is  not  •  risk  incurred,  is  endeavourag  to  amid  it.  of  sacrificing  to  a  chimerical  deeper  the  true  conditions  of  the  smartly  of  the  East  and  of  the  European  equilibrium  ?  Dangers  have  many  times  meeaced  the  Ottoman  Empire  from  other  quarters  than  the  north.  An  Admiral  of  the  Sultan  hes  eves  hese  sees  to  lead  hi.  lest  to  his  rebellious  vases'.  Who  =awe=  that  (mu  of  this  asters  shall  sot'  agate  occur  ?  Moreover  the  English  and  French  fleets  taken,  not  col- lectively b  at  singly,  are  neither  less  powerful  nor  less  dangerous  thee  taws  of  Russia.  Because  the  maritime  estabas:  manta  of  France  and  England  are  farther  cif,  they  are  not  on  that  account  more  inoffensive.  Europe  Is  few  able  to  watch  the  evolutions  of  the  fleets  that  have  them.  By  mesas  of  the  rapidity  of  electric  eanatunisations,  they  could,  by  setting  tail  from  Toulon  and  Malta  at  the  same  time  that  the  Raines  fleet  should  lease  Sebastopol,  arrive  In  time  seflleieet  to  weird  eff  danger  from  the  Porte.  Bet  who  engages  that  they  may  not  one  day  premed  themselme  l  with  the  seat  celerity,  whether  sieg.y  or  collectively,  before  the  Seraglio,  as  enemies  of  the  Peru?  The  tepidity  with  which  the  French  fleet  sailed  towards  Salamis  in  1863,  shows  the  material  possibility  of  this  on  the  part  of  Frames.  Thu  threats  of  which  M.  le  Lavalette  made  see,  prove  its  morel  possibility.

THE  ESCAPE  OF  A  BURGLAR  FROM  THE  MIDDLESEX  HOSPITAL.  It  will  be  recollected  that  about  ten  weeks  ago,  an  at- terript was  made  by  two  men  to  commit  a  burglary  at  the  house  of  Mr.  Hume,  son  of  the  late  Mr.  Joseph  Hume,  M.P.,  in  Harley-street,  but  in  doing  which  they  were  foiled,  when,  in  descending  a  ladder  by  which  they  got  from  an  adjoining  house  to  its  roof,  a  man  named  Ilarrogan  fell  to  the  ground,  whose  right  leg  was  found  to  be  fractured.  He  was  taken  to  Middlesex  Hospital,  where  ho  was  kept  for  about  four  weeks.  He  was  to  have  been  brought  up  to  Marylebone  police  court,  but,  on  the  morning  of  the  day  that  he  was  to  have  appeared  there,  he  was  purloined  from  the  hospital  by  four  men,  between  two  and  four  o'clock  a.m.  Since  then  every  exertion  has  been  made  by  detective  and  other  officers  of  the  metropolitan  police  to  retake  him,  who  did  not  succeed  till  Wednesday  afternoon,  when,  in  consequence  of  information,  two  policemen  of  the  C  division,  with  Vince,  D  division,  who  was  in  charge  of  the  prisoner  at  the  hospital,  went  to  a  house  in  Duck- lane, Westminster,  where  they  found  him  in  bed.  He  was  taken  to  Vine-street  police-station,  and  from  there  to  the  Middlesex  Hospital,  for  the  opinion  of  the  surgeons  when  he  might  be  brought  up  for  examination.  EXAMINATION  OF  THII  PRISONER.  Yesterday  the  prisoner,  whose  name  is  Jas.  Rarrogan,  was  brought  up  from  Middlesex  Hospital  in  a  cab,  and  placed  at  the  bar,  before  Mr.  Long,  charged  with  hav- ing, in  conjunction  with  another  man  not  in  custody,  broken  into  the  house  of  Mr.  Wm.  Burnley  Hume,  18,  Upper  Harley-street,  with  intent  to  steal  and  carryaway  property  therefrom.  Jane  Rudd,  the  under-housemaid,  said—At  half-past  eight  in  the  evening  of  the  Bth  September  I  was  in  my  bedroom  at  the  top  of  the  house,  and  heard  a  noise.  I  went  to  the  door  to  ascertain  what  was  the  cause  thereof,  and  met  a  fellow  -servant  coming  up  stairs.  I  went  into  her  room  with  her,  and  found  that  the  window  was  thrown  completely  up.  Mr.  Hume  sworn—At  a  quarter  to  nine  on  the  even- ing, in  question  I  was  called  by  my  butler,  and  on  going  into  the  serva  n  t  s  '  room  I  saw  that  the  lock  had  been  forced  open.  I  went  out  and  saw  two  men  on  the  roof  of  No.  17.  I  called  to  them,  and  on  asking  them  what  they  wanted,  they  ran  to  the  roof  of  No.  16,  where  a  long  ladder  was  placed.  I  observed  one  of  the  men  slide  down  the  ladder,  and  the  oth  er  ,  w  h  o  ran  down,  missed  his  footing  and  fell  into  the  street.  I  found  him  shortly  afterwards  in  custody  of  a  policeman.  He  had  in  the  fall  broken  his  leg.  Samuel  Sharpe  (the  butler)—l  saw  the  prisoner  come  down  the  ladder,  and  heard  him  exclaim,  I  have  broken  my  leg,  take  me  to  the  I  held  him  until  a  policeman  came,  and  I  then  gave  him  in  charge.  Collard,  59  D—l  took  the  prisoner  into  custody.  The  other  man  had  made  his  escape.  Prisoner,  who  limped  very  much,  told  me  he  had  broken  his  leg,  and  after  I  had  conveyed  him  to  the  station-house  I  took  him  to  Middlesex  Hospital.  Upon  looking  into  the  vehicle,  after  he  bad  been  received  into  the  institution,  I  found  a  life  loaded  at  both  ends  with  lead,  a  wax  taper,  and  a  lucifer  match.  Vince,  259  D—On  22d  October,  at  12  at  night,  I  was  on  duty  at  the  hospital,  having  been  ordered  to  be  there  to  keep  watch  upon  the  prisoner.  He  was  in  bed  in  a  ward  on  the  ground  floor.  At  about  half-past  12  the  nurse  said  to  me,  Will  you  have  a  glass  of  gin  I  did  so,  and  laid  down,  and  at  half-past  one  I  fell  asleep.  I  awoke  between  two  and  three  o'clock  and  found,  to  my  great  surprise,  that  the  prisoner  had  made  his  escape.  Mr.  Long  (to  Inspector  Jackson)--Is  this  witness  still  in  the  force  ?  Inspector--Yes  sir  ;  he  has  not  been  dismissed,  but  has  been  suspended  from  the  period  of  the  occurrence.  The  witness  Vince  added—l  heard  that  the  prisoner  had  been  carried  out.  Search  was  made  everywhere  about  the  place  for  him,  but  he  could  nowhere  be  met  with.  It  was  ascertained  that  a  lock  had  been  taken  off  a  door  leading  into  a  mews  by  the  side  of  the  hospital,  and  through  that  door  the  prisoner  had  undoubtedly  been  removed  away.  Sergeant  Knight,  19  D,  produced  three  picklock  keys,  which  he  picked  up  at  the  corner  of  Devonshire-street  and  Upper  Harley-street,  on  the  evening  of  the  house  being  broken  into.  Siivester,  323  A,  said—l,  accompanied  by  Joy,  187,  and  Cole,  157  C,  went  yesterday  to  a  house  in  Duck-lane,  Westminster,  and  in  the  first  floor  front  room  found  the  prisoner  lying  on  a  bed.  I  told  him  he  must  consider  him- self in  custody  for  breaking  into  Mr.  Hume's  house,  and  escapieg  from  the  hopsital  on  the  22d,  when  he  said  he  hoped  I  would  not  ill-use  him,  and  tbat  he  would  go  quietly.  I  took  him  in  a  cab  to  the  Vine-street  station- house, where  he  was  seen  by  the  divisional  surgeon,  by  whose  direction  he  was  again  taken  to  the  hospital.  Inspector  Jackson  said,  by  direction  of  Mr.  Hughes,  the  superintendent,  he  brought  the  prisoner  up  to  the  court,  and  that  on  he  (witness)  giving  :him  to  under- stand what  he  was  charged  with,  the  only  observation  he  made  was,  have  sent  for  my  solicitor  ;  will  the  case  be  gone  through  to-day  The  prisoner,  who  had  now  nothing  to  say  in  answer  to  the  charge,  was  sent  in  a  cab  to  the  House  of  Deten- tion ;  he  will  be  brought  up  again  on  Thursday  next.  A  strict  investigation  is  going  on  with  regard  to  the  meal':  and  agency  through  which  the  prisoner's  egress  fro  m  the  hospital  was  effected.  ---  We  announced  a  few  weeks  since  the  death  of  the  Wells  Express,  and  we  have  now  to  include  in  our  news- paper obituary  the  name  of  the  .Wells  Advertiser.

The  following  correspondence  has  passed  regarding  he  exemption  of  foreign  holders  of  the  Turkish  Guaran- ,eed Loan  from  any  deduction  for  income  tax  -  Committee  room,  Stock  Exchange,  London,  Nov.  3.  Sir,—l  am  instructed  by  the  Committee  of  the  Stock  Exchange  to  inquire  whether,  in  paying  the  divi-  dends  on  the  Turkish  Four  per  Cent.  Loan,  guaranteed  by,  England  and  F  rance  ,  th  e  i  ncome  t  ax  w  ill  be  deducted  on  such  bonds  as  are  bona  fide  the  property  of  foreigners  residing  abroad  am,  sir,  your  obedient  servant,  `  a  GEO.

Bonds,  the  bona  fide  property  of  foreigners  residing  abroad,  will  be  exempted  from  income  tax,  I  beg  to  transmit  a  copy  of  a  letter  received  from  the  Commis- sioners of  Inland  Revenue  in  reference  thereto,  and  also  a  copy  of  the  declaration  which  will  be  required  in  such  cases.—l  am,  sir,  your  obedient  servant,  M.  MARSHALL.  Webb,  Esq.,  Secretary,  Stock  Revenue,  Somerset•house,  Nov.  12.  Sir,—l  have  laid  before  the  Board  of  Inland  Revenue  your  letter  of  the  atb  inst.,  enclosing  a  copy  of  one  ad- dressed to  you  by  the  Secretary  to  the  Committee  of  the  Stock  Exchange  '  in  which  he  inquires  whether,  in  pay- ing the  divid  en  d  s  on  the  Turkish  Four  per  Cent.  Lnan,  guaranteed  by  England  and  France,  the  income  tax  will  be  deducted  in  those  cases  where  the  bonds  are  bona  fide  the  property  of  foreigners  residing?  abroad,  and  re- questing the  Board's  instruction  as  to  the  answer  to  be  given  to  this  inquiry.  In  reply,  I  have  to  state  that  in  the  opinion  of  the  Board  the  dividends  alluded  to  should  be  exempted  from  the  tax,  when  it  shall  be  satisfactorily  proved  that  they  belong  to  foreigners  residing  abroad.  an  arrangement,  sanctioned  by  the  Board,  it  is  the  practice  of  agents  intrusted  with  the  payment  of  foreign  dividends  not  to  charge  the  tax  in  such  cases,  but  to  pay  the  dividends  ag  full,  on  proof  of  the  necessary  particulars  by  a  declaration.  I  enclose  a  form  of  this  declaration,  and  I  am  to  add  that  the  like  course  should  be  pursued  in  regard  to  the  Turkish  dividends  when  the  Bank  shall  be  satisfied  of  the  truth  of  the  claims.  If  in  any  case  a  doubt  should  be  entertained  on  this  point,  then  the  party  making  the  application  should  be  referred  to  this  office.  am,  Sir,  your  obedient  servant,  THOMAS  KEOGH.  M.  Marsball,  LiA  No.  London,  To  Messrs.

We  have  received  our  letters  and  papers  in  an- ticipation of  the  Overland  Mail.  The  dates  are—  Bombay,  Oct.  17  ;  Calcutta,  Oct.  8.  •  The  following  is  from  the  Bombay  Times  of  Oct.  17  The  Sonthals,  we  regret  to  say,  still  continue  tra  versing  the  country,  and  are  every  here  and  there  committing  acts  of  depredation  and  violence.  The  panic  that  they  at  the  outset  occasioned  was  such  that  the  people  fled  from  the  country,  and  there  still  continues  much  difficulty  in  getting  the  pre- servers of  order  to  withstand  or  secure  the  insur- gents. The  insurrection  has  long  lost  its  character  as  a  civil  war,  and  at  present  continues  simply  as  a  nuisance,  mainly  alarming  from  the  difficulty  of  getting  it  finally  extinguished.  Serious  disturb- ances continue  every  now  and  then  to  break  out  in  the  Nizam's  dominions.  Information  having  been  received  that  a  party  of  Rohilla  robbers  were  plundering  the  country  to  the  north  of  Hyderabad,  a  force  consisting  of  250  men  of  the  Nizarn's  cavalry,  under  Capt.  Doria,  a  wing  of  the  4th  Nizam's  In- fantry, and  a  coupl  e  of  awitzers,  started  on  the  6th  of  September  against  the  enemy.  They  reached  Nandaiar  on  the  morning  of  the  Bth,  but  experi- enced much  difficulty  in  getting  across  the  river  then  in  flood.  They  reached  Sulghurra  on  the  evening  of  the  9th,  after  a  march  of  30  miles.  Here  they  learned  that  the  Rohillas  were  ignorant  of  their  movements,  and  it  was  hoped  to  take  them  by  surprise.  A  further  march  of  40  miles,  on  which  they  were  compelled  to  leave  their  howitzers  behind,  brought  them  to  Bander  Koontah  by  day- break on  the  12th.  The  Rohillas  were  now  only  a  mile  a  head,  and  the  infantry,  under  Capt.  Daniel,  with  a  few  cavalry,  under  Lieut.  Biden,  dashed  on  and  took  the  enemy  wholly  unawares.  A  few  of  them  showed  fight,  and  10  or  12  were  cut  down  ;  136  were  taken  prisoners,  of  whom  25  were  found  wounded.  They  had  hardly  well  secured  their  cap- tives and  concentrated  their  force,  when  they  heard  of  another  body  of  Rohollas  having  established  themselves  at  Lingi,  a  couple  of  miles  off.  Thither- ward the  infantry,  with  a  few  troopers,  started  in  the  afternoon.  As  they  approached  the  village  the  enemy  made  their  escape  and  no  traces  of  them  could  for  a  time  be  discovered,  till  a  man  found  in  hiding  undertook  to  show.  where  they  were,  and  they  were  soon  afterwards  seen  skulking  in  a  ravine  close  by.  It  was  now  dark,  and  the  bulk  of  them  made  their  escape-17  were  taken  prisoners.  On  their  return  to  camp,  another  party  was  found  in  hiding  ;  of  these  seven  were  captured.  The  extrordinary  rapidity  with  which  this  most  successful  expedition  was  conducted  is  worthy  of  mention.  Their  second  march  was  thirty  miles  in  length  ;  in  their  third  they  covered  forty  miles  in  thirty  hours,  over  a  country  partly  of  black  cotton  soil,  softened  by  showers,  and  partly  covered  with  loose  jagged  stones.  The  country  after  this  seems  to  have  been  quiet  for  a  time  ;  that  it  should  con- tinuo so  for  a  month  on  end  would  be  contrary  to  all  precedent.  Religious  disturbances  have  once  more  made  their  appearance  in  Oade,  and  they  are  not  likely  on  this  occasion  to  be  so  easily  disposed  of  as  for- merly. In  February  last,  a  Hindoo  renegade,  who  had  become  Mahomedan,  spread  about  a  statement  that  the  Hindoos  had  defiled  and  dultroyed  a  temple  in  Hunnoomanghurree.  Contriving  to  col- lect a  considerable  force,  he  proeeeded  thitherward,  and  established  his  head-quarters  in  the  neigh- bourhood ;  a  violent,  conflict  ensued,  in  which  the  Hindoos  proved  victorious  ;  some  seventy  or  eighty  of  the  Mahomedans  cut  their  way  through  and  found  refuge  in  one  of  their  own  temples  near  by.  The  Hindoos,  in  a  state  of  the  most  violent  excitement,  now  attacked  the  temple,  and,  after  repeated  repulses  with  h  eav  y  l  oss  o  f  life,  succeeded  in  capturing  it,  and  putting  the  whole  of  their  enemies  to  the  sword.  This  was  but  the  com- mencement of  the  strife,  and  both  parties  are  now  so  violently  inflamed  that  it  is  impossible  to  foresee  the  result.  The  Punjaub  frontier  continues  as  usual  disturbed.  Parties  of  robbers  every  now  and  then  descend  from  their  glens  and  attack  our  villages,  and  so  continua  to  pester  us,  till  we  are  from  time  to  time  compelled  to  exact  from  them  a  heavy  retri- bution. The  policy  brought  into  existence  by  Sir  George  Arthur,  in  1844,  of  stopping  the  promotion  of  civilians  encumbered  with  debt,  is  now  being  rigidly  enforced  by  Government,  with  promise  of  infinite  advantage  to  the  country.  Were  the  order  made  absolute  and  universal,  and  young  men  on  their  arrival  in  India  made  aware  that  from  the  moment  they  became  in  debt  their  promotion  would  cease,  the  benefit  resulting  to  the  parties  them- selves would  be  indescribable.  The  Bombay  gov  ernmen  t  have  been  indefatiga- ble in  their  ende  avours  t  o  mitigate  or  provide  against  the  scarcity  o  f  wa  t  er  apprehended  in  the  beginning  of  next  year,  in  consequence  of  the  ex- treme scantiness  of  the  monsoon.  A  committe3,  consisting  of  Dr.  Carter,  Dr.  Leith,  Dr.  Buist,  Mr.  Aher,  Major  Crawf  or  d,  and  Mr.  Berkley  ,  have  been  appointed  to  examine  the  geological  structure  of  the  hills,  constituting  the  projected  reservoir  in  Salsette,  suspicions  having  arisen  that  these  may  be  traversed  by  stratifi  e  d  roc  k  s  p  e  rmeable  to  water.  Singularly  enough  this  matter  seems  to  have  been  overlooked,  and  though  we  have  been  nearly  ten  years  employed  in  examininc  ,  the  other  condit  ions  of  the  Vehar  hills,  th  e  most  i  m  p  o  rtant  of  them  all  appears  to  have  been  neglected.—The  first  cotton  spinning  factory  e  s  t  a  bli  s  h  e  d  i  n  Western  India  com- menced its  operations  at  Broach  on  the  Bth  of  October,  no  more  than  ten  months  having  been  occupied  from  their  commencement  to  their  com- pletion in  constrncting  the  works.  The  enterprise,  which  owes  its  origin  exclusively  to  Mr.  Landon,  is  one  of  the  greatest  promise,  and  if  s  uccessful  will  be  the  source  of  countless  benefits  to  the  country.  The  weather  of  late  has  been  showery  and  threat- ening, indicating  showers  on  the  other  side  of  India.  The  Governor-General  is  stil  on  the  Neilgherries.  Lord  Harris  and  General  Anson  are  about  to  return  to  Madras  after  a  shortvisit  to  the  hills.  Lord  E  .  Iphin- stone continues  to  remain  at  the  Presidency,  Sir  Henry  Somerset  and  the  Bishop  being  at  Ma- hawbleshwar, the  latter  is  about  to  proceed  on  an  episcopal  tour  to  Scinde,  but  whether  he  will  go  further  than  Kurrachee  is  still  an  open  question.  Sir  Lawrence  Peel  being  about  to  retire  from  his  seat  on  the  bench  at  Calcutta,  Sir  Chas.  Jackson  has  been  removed  from  Bombay  to  fill  the  vacancy  occasioned  by  the  promotion  of  Sir  James  Colville  to  succeed  Sir  Lawrence  Peel  as  Chief  Justice.

The  Austrian  steamer,  direct  from  Trieste,  due  here  on  the  Ist,  had  to  take  shelter  from  bad  weather  in  a  port  on  the  Adriatic,  and  arrived  here  only  yesterday  even- ing, and  some  15  passengers,  who  intended  to  pro- ceed to  India  from  Suez  by  the  presentmail,  pushed  on  at  once  for  Suez,  although  they  have  but  a  slight  chance  of  catching  the  steamer  there.  The  French  steamer  due  here  from  Marseilles  on  the  Ist  has  not  yet  made  her  appearance.  Said  Pasha,  the  Viceroy,  in  the  beginning  of  last  week  brought  down  to  Alexandria,  from  the  inte- rior, a  great  number  of  troops  and  three  days  after- wards started  with  them  for  the  Nile,  taking  back  infantry,  cavalry,  and  horse  artillery.  The  town  of  Alexandria  is  occasionally  full  of  soldiers,  and  suddenly  they  disappear,  as  if  the  Viceroy's  object  was  to  keep  them  constantly  on  the  move.  His  Highness  is  just  now  on  the  site  of  the  Barrage  in- specting the  building  of  thefortifications  of  the  new  town,  to  be  called  after  himself,  Saidieb  t  of  which  he  laid  the  foundation  last  spring.  Meanwhile  the  governors  of  the  provinces  are  taking  every  advantage  of  the  administration  of  affairs,  and  plunder  and  tyrannise  over  the  natives  as  much  as  they  can.  The  Governor  of  Suez  in  particular  is  acting  with  more  boldness  on  account  of  the  dis- tance at  which  he  is  from  the  Pasha,  and  for  his  own  benefit  taxes  the  inhabitants  of  the  town  and  the  pilgrims  to  and  from  Mecca  to  an  enormous  extent.  Said  Pasha  is  still  waging  war  with  the  Bedouins  of  the  desert,  and  recently,  having  induced  a  num- ber of  them  to  give  themselves  up  with  the  delu- sion of  reconcialition,  they  were  all  put  to  death.  It  is  very  bad  policy  on  the  part  of  the  Viceroy  not  to  be  on  amicable  terms  with  the  Bedouin  tribes,  who  occupy  the  desert  all  round  Egpyt,  for  they  have  it  in  their  power  to  do  much  injury  to  the  inhabitants  of  the  cultivated  lands  by  sudden  fo- rays, and  then  withdraw  into  their  native  deserts,  where  they  are  quite  beyond  the  reach  of  the  army.  If  the  Bedouins  find  that  the  Pasha  is  deter- mined upon  keeping  on  bad  terms  with  them,  the  transit  will  not  be'io  secure  as  it  has  been,  for  there  is  nothing  to  prevent  them  plundering  the  station- houses in  the  desert,  or  attacking  travellers  be- tween Cairo  and  Suez,  and  some  robberies  have  already  been  committed  on  that  road.  Some  workmen  who  are  boring  for  M.  de  Les- seps on  the  line  which  he  proposes  to  take  for  his  Suez  Canal  scheme  have  come  upon  hard  rock,  which  quite  nullifies  the  estimates  put  forth  by  him  in  his  pamphlet  on  the  subject,  in  which  he  assumes  that  the  canal  will  be  dug  entirely  out  of  sand  or  light  soil.  Ancient  history  informs  us  that  in  the  year  610  before  Christ  a  canal  to  connect  the  Medi- terranean and  Red  Seas  was  commenced  and  aban- doned in  12  mouths,  after  a  loss  of  120,000  men.  Mr.  Pasquale,  the  projector  of  the  Bank  of  Egypt,  with  English  shareholders,  has  failed  to  ob- tain from  the  Viceroy  for  his  bank  any  exclu- sive privileges.  In  answer  to  his  application,  Said  Pasha  informed  him,  through  his  secretary,  that  the  trade  of  Egypt  was  perfectly  free  ;  that  be  had  no  objection  to  the  formation  of  the  bank,  and  that  it  might  benefit  the  trade  of  the  country  ;  but  his  Highness  seems  to  have  taken  care  not  to  compro- mise himself  in  any  way,  or  to  pledge  himself  to  give  to  the  bank  any  assistance  or  support.  An  agent  of  the  Crimea  Land  Transport  Corps  has  been  hero  since  September,  engaging  natives  for  work  at  the  seat  of  war.  He  has  enlisted  some  500  or  600  men  ;  they  are  daily  fed  and  lodged  at  no  small  cost  to  the  British  Government.  They  do  nothing  ;  no  steamer  comes  to  carry  them  off,  and  it  is  anticipated  that  when  the  time  comes  for  them  to  embark,  a  large  proportion  of  them  will  disappear.  The  last  steamer  from  Beyrout  brought  news  that  Lady  Emmeline  Wortley  was  very  ill  there,  and  not  expected  to  live.  She  and  her  daughter  have  been  travelling  in  Syria  during  the  hottest  summer  months  ;  their  maid  died  of  a  coup  de  soleil  ;  two  or  three  different  servants  and  couriers  were  obliged  to  leave  their  service  from  their  in- ability to  stand  the  fatigues  of  travelling  in  the  hot  season  Cthe  daughter  had  a  coup  de  soleil,  and  Lady  Emily,  after  having  dislocated  her  leg  at  Jerusalem,  had  suffered  from  intermittant  fever,  and  was  dying  of  dysentery.  Some  cases  of  cholera  have  occurred  among  the  shipping  in  the  harbour,  though  the  town  is  quite  free  from  the  disease.  Prices  of  produce  keep  up  very  high.  Exchange  on  London  has  gone  up  to  93  piastres  per  pound  sterling,  in  consequence  of  large  impor- tations of  specie.  TILE  HOLY  WAR  IN  OUDE.  (From,  the  Della  Gazette.)  Seven  or  eight  months  ago  one  Shah  Gholam  Hussein,  a  dissolute  vagabond,  formerly  a  Hindoo,  but  like  many  others  at  Lucknow,  a  pervert  to  Islam,  with  that  fierce  rancour  which  animates  renegades,  published  through-  out  Lucknow  and  the  principal  Mabommedan  towns  and  villages  of  Oude,  that  the  Hindoos  had  lately  de- stroyed and  defiled  a  Musjid,  which  until  recently  had  existed  in  Hunooman  G-Ouree.  This  monstrous  fable  was  eagerly  believed  ;  hundreds  came  forward  to  wipe  out  this  dire  insult  to  Islam,  and  Shah  Gholam  Hussein,  cleverly  takin  g  a  d  van  t  a  ge  of  the  credulity  of  his  dupes,  proclaimed  his  mission.  He  was  empowered  to  raise  the  sten  lard  of  Islam,  had  been  encouraged  in  visions  ;  he  had  been  honoured  by  divine  revelation,  and  now  boldly  proclaimed  a  crusade  against  the  infidel.  Col- lecting a  very  large  force  of  bigoted  and  well-armed  fol.  lowers,  he  placed  himself  at  their  head  and  marched  on  Hunooman  Ghuree.  Selecting  a  Mujid  not  far  from  the  sacred  shrines  of  the  Hindoos,  the  Shah  and  his  fa- natics made  it  their  head-quarters,  and  prepared  for  vic- tory or  death.  Those  who  were  on  the  spot  and  in  authority  made  use  of  every  argument  to  deter  them  from  their  insane  object.  Everything  that  was  prac- ticable was  urged  to  dissaude  them,  but  in  vain.  Teey  had  resolved  to  win  or  die,  and  calmly  replied,  have  dug  our  After  reciting  the  noon- day prayers,  and  pronouncing  one  and  all  the  and  exhorting  each  other  to  win  paradise  by  slaughtering  the  infidels—  the  Mahomedans  sallied  out,  and  invoking  God  and  His  Prophet,  opened  fire  on  the  defenders  of  the  Hunooman  Ghuree.  But  the  priests  had  been  neither  inactive,  nor  indifferent  to  what  had  been  threat- ening for  some  time.  They  were  fully  prepared.  In  an  instant,  from  house,  shop,  temple,  tenement,  and  gardens,—Rajpoots,  Chatrees,  Rajkoornars,  in  hundreds  poured  fourth  in  defence  of  their  priests  and  time-ho- noured shrines.  A  desperate  hand  to  hand  combat  en•  sued  ;  the  numbers  and  bravery  of  the  Hindoos  soon  turned  the  scale  ;  outnumbered,  overpowered,  attacked  on  all  sides,  the  Mahomedans  gave  way,  were  routed,  pursued,  and  put  to  the  sword.  Some  70  or  80,  however,  cut  their  way  through,  ncade  good  their  retreat,  and  regained  the  Musjid.  Protected  by  massive  walls  and  well  armed,  they  imagined  them- selves safe,  their  position  impregnable.  But  a  terrible  fate  awaited  them.  The  passions  of  the  Hindoos  had  now  been  thoroughly  aroused,  blood  had  been  profusely  shed  ;  nothing  but  the  lives  of  their  foes  could  appease  their  thirst  of  vengeance.  The  Hindoos  swarmed  like  bees  round  the  Musjid,  but  at  a  distance  a  brief  consultation  was  held.  It  was  re-  solved  to  storm  the  11Tusjid  at  all  risks,  and  to  destroy  their  assailants.  A  band  of  priests  and  Jogees,  with  matted  locks  and  begrimed  from  head  to  foot  with  dust  and  ashes,  stepped  forward  to  lead  the  assault,  swords  in  band.  But  the  Chatrees  and  Rajkoomars  waved  them  back,  declaring  that  the  work  before  them  was  not  such  as  holy  men  should  engage  in,  and  they  were  forced  to  retire.  A  dense  column  now  advanced  straight  upon  the  gate  of  the  Musjid.  With  one  tremendous  yell  of  Bum  Maha- deo !  the  Ilindoos,  sword  in  hand,  dashed  at  the  Musjid,  and  nearly  gamed  the  walls,  when  a  smashing  volley,  poured  in  at  ten  paces  distance,  destroyed  the  leading  ranks,  staggered  the  column  and  drove  it  back  in  con- fusion. Again  reforming  their  shattered  ranks  and  en- couraging each  other  by  voice  and  gesture,  the  Rajpoots  rushed  at  the  gate,  but  again  were  received  by  a  well- directed and  galling  fire,  and  a  second  time  were  driven  back,  broken,  routed,  and  in  terrible  confusion.  As  each  Hindoo  fell  his  body  was  instantly  passed  from  man  to  man  to  the  rear,  and  at  once  consigned  to  the  river.  Some  few  minutes  BOW  elapsed  ;  a  brief  consultation  was  held,  and  for  the  third  time  with  terrible  cries  and  frantic  gestures,  the  Rajpoots  stormed  the  Musjid,  were  met  by  a  crushing  fire,  but  succeeded  in  gaining  the  %ails  and  forcing  the  gate.  No  quarter  was  asked  for,  cr  given  ;  on  all  sides  the  clash  of  steel,  the  ringing  shouts  of  the  combatants,  and  the  shrill  screams  of  the  multi- tude outside  resounded,  blood  ran  ancle  deep  in  the  Musjid  ;  and  in  a  few  moments  every  one  of  the  Moham- medans was  put  to  the  sword.  Thus  terminated  the  ill-starred  expedition  of  Shah_  Gholam  Hussein.  The  author,  at  the  commencemento  the  fray,  threw  away  his  garments,  a  nd  his  divine  1  mis- sion, and  trusting  to  his  heels  rathe  r  than  toh  d  is  re  .  v  a.  tion,  nimbly  made  his  escape,  and  disappeare  -----  THE  MURDER  NEAR  SIIOTLEY-BRIDGE.—A  reward  of  3001.,  of  which  the  Government  pays  1001:,  has  been  offered  for  the  apprehension  of  the  murderer  of  Mr.  Stirling,  surgeon,  who  was  shoton,  robbed  and  murdered,  in  the  open  day,  a  short  distance  from  Gibside-park,  in  the  county  of  Durham,  this  day  fort- night.

If  the  whole  amount  applied  for  be  not  allotted,  the  prop  rtion  of  the  deposit  will  be  returned  forthwith.  New-court,  St.  Swithin's-lane,  April  (From  the  Daily  News'  City  Article  of  this  day.)  The  absorbing  topic  of  interest  in  the  City  to-day  was  of  course  the  Government  loan.  We  give  in  another  column  the  conditions  fixed  by  the  Treasury,  together  with  an  abstract  of  the  proceedings  at  the  important  meeting  of  capitalists  at  the  Treasury  Chambers  this  day.  The  total  amount  of  the  proposed  loan  is.  16,0011,000/.  in  cash,  to  be  raised  by  an  issue  of  16,000,0001.  in  Consols  at  par.  Inasmuch,  however,  as  Consols  are  Low  at  .9  .  4  per  cent.  discount  in  the  market  (from  which  discount,  however,  must  be  dedgcted  the  three  months'  dividend  now  accrued,  being  equal  to,  say,  per  cent.),  capitalists  contracting  for  the  loan  are  to  receive  a  certain  amount  in  annuities  expiring  thirty  years  hence.  In  these  annuities  the  bidlings  are  to,  be  made,  and  in  fixing  a  price  in  his  tender  the  capitalist  will  of  course  make  allow- ance for  the  excess  over  the  niarket  price  which  he  gives  to  Government  for  this  new  creation  of  consols,  and  he  will  also  reserve  a  certain  margin,  which  he  may  deem  calculated  to  afford  him  a  profit  on  the  transaction,  and  to  secure  him  against  the  chances  of  loss  attendant  upon  the  uncertain  con- ditiou of  politics:  Per  contra,  the  ease  of  the  money  market  will  influence  the  terms  of  the  contractor  in  a  sense  favourable  to  the  Treasury  and  to  the  State.  '  So  far  as  regards  the  nego- tiation between  the  contractor.  and  the  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer,  the  relations  between  the  contractor  and  the  monied  public  di  ,  posed  to  invest  in  the  proposed  new  issue  of  Government  securities  come  next  for  consideration.  Of  the  great  capitalists  only  one  firm,  that  of  Messrs.  N.  M.  Rothschild  and  Sous,  has  yet  intimated  an  intention  to  open  lists  to  the  public.  The  notice  issued  by  this  firm  this  after- noon is  appended  :  Loan  of  Sixteen  Millions  to  the  British  Government.—  Messrs.  N.  M.  Rothschild  and  Sons  beg  to  announce  to  the  public,  that  they  arc  ready  to  receive  applications  from  par- ties desirous  of  participating  in  the  forthcoming  loan  of  six- teen millions,  and  will  receive  the  same  until  Thursday  next  at  two  o'clock.  It  is  necessary  that  every  application  should  be  accompanied  with  a  deposit  of  10  per  cent  on  the  amount  applied.  If  the  whole  amount  applied  for  be  not  al  otted,  the  proportion  of  the'deposit  will  be  returned  forthwith.  New  court,  St.  Swithin's-lane,  April  16,  It  will  be  noticed  that  the  price  at  which  he  may  be  dis- posed to  tender  is  left  to  each  individual  applicant,  it  being  pr6sumed  that  the  bona  fides  of  the  application  will  be  en- sured, and  the  proffering  of  inordinately  low  terms  discou- raged, by  the  obligation  of  making  a  deposit  of  ten  per  cent.  on  the  amount  applied  for.  It  may  be  pointed  out  that  the  Messrs.  Rothschild,  of  any  other  great  firm  that  may  be  dis-  Po  .  ed  to  step  forward  and  contract,  will  act  as  an  inter- mediate agent  thyeugli  whom  the  mass  of  individual  ap- plications will  be  received.  By  deciding  that  the  co  -tractor  must  contract  for  the  whole,  and  not  for  any  less  portion  of  the  loan,  the  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  virtually  leaves  the  contract  open  for  competition  to  not  more  than  two  or  three  firms  in  the  contracting  firm,  again,  must  ascertain  what  support  the  public  are  likely  to  give  to  the  project  before  they  commit  themselves  to  a  .contract  with  the  state.  In  this  point  of  view  the  scheme  lacks  the  element  of  popularity.  An  appre- hension is  alSo  entertained  in  some  quarters  that  the  interval  allowed  is  scarcely  tufficient  for  the  public  to  fully  digest  the  terms  of  the  loan,  the  complexity  of  which,  without  lull  ex- lilanatio.), may  toud  to  discourage  applicants.  The  entire  loan,  it  will  be  seen,  is  to  be  paid  up  this  year,  the  last  in- stalment on  the  18th  December,  and  no  discount  is  to  be  allowed  for  prompt  payment  of  the  iustaltnents.  The  Chan- cellor of  the  Exchequer  further  pledged  himself  not  to  make  any  further  sales  of  Savings  Bank  Stock  (except  to  meet  the  withdrawal  of  depositors)  until  the  loan  shall  have  been  paid  up.  11.41iKET  W,s—tTillb  DAY.)

Mr.  Du  ncan  opposed,  and  Mr.  Buchanan  supported  the  bankrni.  4.  The  balan,  ce-sheet  extended  from  March,  1354,  to  May,  1855.  His  creditors  unsecured  were  stated  at  1.904/.,  and  his  profits  at  573/.  His  good  debts  were  73/.,  doubtful  ant;  bad  11.,  property  less  creditors  in  full  4541.,  excepted  an  idles  201.,  trade  expenses  4081.,  in- terest and  banker's  co  mmission  431.,  law  costs  31.,  repairs  221.,  domestic  and  personal  expenses  3771.,  losses  9801.,  deficiency  at  commencement  1001.  Mr.  Duncan  opposed  the  bankrupt  on  several  grounds.  One  was  that  he  had  omitted  to  enter  in  his  balance- sheet a  debt  of  251.,  goods  supplied  on  sale  or  return.  Until  that  had  been  amended  and  other  matters  ex- plained, the  bankrupt  milt  not  to  pass  his  last  exami- nation. Mr.  Buchanan  contended  the  omission  complained  of  was  not  material,  being  an  error  easily  remedied.  His  Honour  considered  the  omission  complained  of  fatal  to  the  bankrupt  passing  his  last  examination  to- day, and  accordingly  adjourned  it  to  allow  of  the  balance-sheet  being  amended.  CENTRAL  CRIMINAL  COURT.-(T1L1,5  ___.  DAY).  OLD  COURT.  (Before  Mr.  Justice  Erle.)  Rebecca  Turton,  a  middle-aged  woman,  was  indicted  for  the  wilful  murder  of  her  husband,  Thomas  Turton,  by  strangling  him.  The  learned  counsel  for  the  prosecution  said  that  the  circumstances  of  the  case  were  rather  of  an  extraordi- nary character,  the  offence  imputed  to  the  prisoner  hav- ing been  committed  so  far  back  as  April,  1854,  and  he  said  that  the  delay  had  been  occasioned  by  the  circum- stance that  the  prisoner  immediately  after  the  act  had  been  committed  was  in  a  state  of  decided  insanity,  and  was  confined  for  nearly  12  months  in  a  lunatic  asylum.  She  was  now,  however,  sufficiently  recovered  to  enable  her  to  take  her  trial,  and  the  jury  would  have  to  say  by  their  verdict  whether  the  evidence  that  he  should  lay  before  them  was  sufficient  to  justify  them  in  coming  to  the  conclusion  that  the  prisoner  was  guilty  of  the  serious  crime  imputed  to  her  by  the  present  indictment.  He  then  proceeded  to  state  the  facts  of  the  case,  and  it  appeared  that  the  deceased  was  a  labouring  man,  and  he  and  the  prisoner  occupied  two  rooms  in  a  house  in  Richard-street,  Bromley.  It  appeared  that  about  9  o'clock  at  night,  on  the  21st  of  April,  the  deceased  came  home  partially  intoxicated  and  went  to  bed,  no  one,  of  course,  but  the  prisoner  being  with  him,  and  between  1  and  2  o'clock  on  the  following  morning  the  prisoner  gave  an  alarm  and  said  that  her  husband  was  dead,  and  upon  the  landlord  of  the  house  going  into  the  bed-room  the  deceased  was  found  lying  upois  the  bed,  and  there  was  a  cord  mark  round  his  neck,  as  though  some  ligature  had  been  tied  tightly  around  it  and  the  death  of  the  deceased  was  evidently  the  result  of  strangulation.  Upon  a  search  being  made  in  the  room,  one  of  the  braces  worn  by  the  deceased  was  found,  and  when  this  was  compared  with  the  mark  upon  the  neck  of  the  deceased,  it  corresponded  exactly,  and  the  buckle,  in  particular,  seemed  to  have  been  the  cause  of  an  abrasure  that  was  manifest  upon  the  neck,  under  the  left  ear.  The  prisoner,  who  appeared  in  a  very  excited  state,  was  taken  into  custody,  and  on  the  following  morning  she  asked  the  female  searcher  to  allow  herto  pray,  and  she  knelt  down,  and  then  said  it  was  a  very  bad  job,  and  she  afterwards  exclaimed  What  will  the  devil  not  tempt  any  one  to  do  when  they  are  in  a  passion  She  subsequently  said,  Poor  Tom  is  dead,  and  I  did  The  surgeons  who  were  examined  expressed  their  opi- nion that  the  deceased  had  been  strangled  suddenly  in  his  sleep,  and  that  he  was  unable  to  offer  any  resistance,  and  there  appeared  to  be  no  doubt  that  the  prisoner's  was  the  hand  that  inflicted  the  violence.  It  appeared,  however,  that  she  bad  for  some  days  before  the  fatal  occurrence  behaved  in  the  most  extraordinary  manner,  and  on  the  night  of  the  20th  April  she  had  taken  a  policeman  into  her  husband's  room,  telling  him  that  he  bad  poisoned  himself  with  arsenic  ;  but  it  ap- peared that  he  was  perfectly  well  at  that  time  and  when  the  policeman  told  him  what  his  wife  had  said  he  said  that  there  was  no  foundation  for  her  statement,  and  he  added  that  he  did  not  know  what  to  do  with  his  wife,  and  he  thought  she  was  going  mad.  It  also  appeared  that  the  prisoner  bad  called  out  to  a  po- liceman from  her  bedroom  window,  and  asked  him  if  he  was  the  devil,  and  also  said  that  she  could  see  the  cats  scratching  dead  bodies  out  of  their  graves.  It  was  like- wise proved  that  when  the  prisoner  was  committed  to  Newgate  in  May  last  to  take  her  trial  for  this  offence  she  was  insane,  and  not  in  a  condition  to  plead,  and  it  appeared  that  she  was  removed  to  Bedlam,  and  subse- quently to  a  private  asylum.  The  learned  Judge,  at  the  close  of  the  evidence  of  Mr.  M'Murdo,  expressed  his  o  pinion  that  it  was  unnecessary  to  proceed  any  further  with  the  inquiry,  as  he  did  not  think  the  jury  could  entertain  any  doubt  that  at  the  time  the  offence  was  committed  the  prisoner  was  insane.  The  jury  said  they  were  of  opinion  that  this  was  the  fact,  and  they  at  once  acquitted  the  prisoner  on  the  ground  of  insanity,  NEW  COURT.  (Before  the  Recorder.)  John  CoNog  and  Joltn  Clarke,  two  respectable•looking  young  men,  were  indicted  for  stealing  a  fishing-rod,  valued  at  145.,  the  property  of  Frederick  Nicholson.  Mr,  Robinson  prosecuted,  and  Mr.  W.  Cooper  de-  fended.  It  appeared  that  upon  the  18th  of  July  the  prosecutor,  e  aotferwas  missed  it.  Infor- a youth,  was  at  a  frie  nd  '  s  at  Cranbrook,  Essex,  fishing,  rdli  c  s  e  en  in  the  neigh  and  some  hours  ra  and  having  left  off  placed  his  rod  against  a  wall  inside  of  the  garden,  and  some  tim  afterwards  a  ti  o  having  e  twobee  n  prisonersgive  n  tt  he  were  p  o  seen  bourhood,  one  of  them  with  the  rod,  which  he  was  openly  carrying,  and  h  told  e  immediately  the  police  that  they  had  found  it  in  a  garden.  Both  prisoners,  it  appeared,  bore  an  extremely  good  character  at  Ilford,  where  they  had  lived  nearly  all  their  lives.  The  jury  immediately  acquitted  the  prisoners.

The  25th  of  November  mail  only  reached  us  on  the  20th  ult.,  the  steamer  Shanghai  having  put  into  Manilla  for  coals.  Our  last  'was  dated  the  15th  ult.,  since  wbell,  we  have  to  report  a  considerable  change  in  political  !affairs  in  this  country.  !DEFEAT  OF  THE  REBELS  AT  CANTON,—  :  SUA.NGIIAI  RETAKEN  BY  THE  IMPE- ' RIALISTS,ANDFRIGHTFULSLA.UGHTER.  From  Shanghai  our  advices  are  to  the  9th  inst.  The  city  was  retaken  by  the  Imperialists  on  the  night  of  the  17th  ult.  (Chinese  New  'Year's-day).  They  set  fire  to  it  at  various  points,  and  a  large  portion  of  it  was  burnt.  The  rebels  were  killed  or  dispersed,  and  the  people  are  rebuilding  in  their  old  quarters.  The  foreigners  who  were  in  the  rebel  service  made  their  escape  to  Woosung  on  the  day  preceding  the  attack,  and  treachery  on  the  part  of  'rthe  Canton  men  admitted  the  linperial  troops.  Lew,  the  rebel  chief  ;  has  been  beheaded,  •but  Chin-a-ling  has  escaped.  Less  bloodshed  than  was  anticipated  took  place,  and  the  Imperial  general,  showed  great  forbearance  and  humanity  towards  the  people.  There  was  a  large  supply  of  powders  &amp;c.,  in  the'city,  but  scarcely  any  food,  and  those  who  were  not  fighting  men  were  reduced  to  the  greatest  straits.  The  capture  of  the  city  has  given  universal  satis- faction. The  marines  of  the  French  frigate-  La.  Jeanne  d'Arc  assisted  in  keeping  order  and  pre- venting robbery.  The  troops  which  were  encamped  around  Shanghai  have  been  sent  with  all  speed  to  operate  against  Nankin  -  and  Chin-kiatig,  where  the  rebels  are  said  to  be  losing  ground,  but  we  have  no  authentic  intelligence  to  rely  on.  Her  Majesty's  Consul  at  Shanghai,  by  order  of  his  Excellency  Sir  John  Bowring,  returned  the  bonds  for  duties  given  between  the  7th  of  September,  1853,  and  the  9th  February,  1854.  •  The  United  St  a  t  es  '  s  t  ea  mer  Powbattan  arrived  at  Shanghai  on  the  2d  inst.,  with  intelliaenCe  from  Japan  to  the  22d  ult.  The  United  Stales'  treaty  was  ratified  on  the  21st.  The  island  of  Niphon  was  visited  on  the  23d  of  December  with  a  most  severe  earthquake,  whereby  the  towns  of  Ohosaca  and  Simoda  were  destroyed,  and  Jeddo  much  injured.  The  Russian  frigate  Diana,  which  was  at  Japan  with  Admiral  Pontiatin,  on  a  diplomatic  mission,  was  totally  wrecked,  but  all  hands  saved.  At  Canton  the  Imperialists  have  gained  a  com  plete  victory  over  a  large  rebel  fleet,  and  the  river  traffic  is  again  open  to  native  craft,  and  large  sup- plies of  the  necessaries  of  life  are  thus  conveyed  to  the  Canton  market.  Previously  great  distress  was  felt  by  the  poorer  classes,,  prices  being  ruinously  high.  The  insurgents  have  been  driven  from  their  head-quarters  near  Whampoa,  the  greater  part  of  their  fleet  taken  or  destroyed,  the  town  of  Sanchow  burnt,  and  Blenheim  Fort  recaptured.  This  took  place  on  the  7th  inst.,  the  Mandarins  having  been  strengthened  by  the  adherence  of  many  influential  villages,  whose  acted  on  shore  and  ,  -a.ve  no  quarter  to  the  reb  e  l  s  w  h  o  f  e  ll  i  n  t  o  th  e  i  r  hands..'  This  success,  if  promptly  and  energetically  followed  up,  may  be  productive  of,  much  ultimate  good  ;  but  it  must  be  remembered  that,  although  this  one  body  of  rebels  has  been  destroyed,  there  are  many  other  bands  which  must  be  subdued  ere  trade  can  be  re-established  on  any  secure  basis.  As  yet  there  is  no  improvement.  The  rebel  chiefs  have  escaped  with  a  portion  of  their  fleet,  and  will  doubtless  go  to  increase  the  number  of  pirates  who  swarm  at  the  entrance  and  on  the  river.  Her  Majesty's  ship  Comus  remains  at  Canton,  and  the  Spartan,  at  Whampoa.  The  business  in  imports  and  exports  at  Canton  has  been  very  limited.  Freights  nominal,  at  5/.  ss.  At  Shanghai  the  demand  for  imp,,rts  had  been  stick,  but  improvement  was  looked  for.  The  pur- chases o  f  tea  h  a  d  been  to  a  fair  extent.  Silk  was  slightly  cheaper.  Freights  4/.  At  Foochow  and  Anioy  there  has  been  nothing  of  importance  to  notice.  The  vessels  Tom  Bowline  (British)  and  the,  Living  Age  (American)  have  been  wrecked  on  the  Pratas  Shoal  ;  both  vessels  tea  laden,  the  former  bound  from  .  Foochow  for  London,  the  latter  from  Shanghai  for  New  York.  The  captains  and  crews  have  reached  this,  with  the  exception  of  the  second  officer  and  two  men  of  the  Torn  Bowline,  who  were  lost.  His  Excellency  Sir  John  Bowring,  accompanied  by  Messrs.  H.  S.  Parker,  G.  W.  Caine,  and  J.  C.  Bowring,  left  for  Siam  in  her•  Majesty's  steamer  Rattler  on  the  12th  instant.  Her  Majesty's  brig  Grecian  accompanies  the  Rattler.  His  Excellency  Sir  James  Stirling  is  at  present  here,  but  it  is  stated  that  he  leaves  in  her  Majes- ty's ship  Winchester,  for  Japan,  at  the  end  of  this  Month,  to.  ratify'  the  treaty  previously  entered  into.  Her  Majesty's  ship  Sybil  arrived  from  Singa- pore on  the  4th,  and  her  Majesty's  steamer  Hornet  yesterday.  The  former  we  hear  is  to  join  the  Pa- cific squadron,  and  also  her  Majesty's  steamer  Bar- racouta, which  left  this  for  Shanghai  on  the  12th  inst.  His  Imperial  French  Majesty's  ship  Sybille,  52,  arrived  here  on  the  sth  inst.  ;  100  of  her  crew  have  been  lost  from  dysentery.

REPORT  ON  THE  STATE  OF  THE  BOMBAY  MARKETS  FROM  MARCH  10  TO  APRIL  1.  The  English  mail,  with  dates  to  the  25th  of  Feb.,  reached  on  the  morning  of  Sunday,  the  25th.  In  our  last  we  noticed  the  opening  of  a  Five  per  Cent.  Loan  by  Government,  but  we  were  unable  to  state  th  e  terms  g  en  which  it  was  opened.  Th  ese  h  ave  now  reac  h  e  d  us  ,  and,  with  the  exception  that  this  is  styled  P  u  bli  c  Works  an  there  appears  to  be  nothing  different  in  this  loan  from  that  paid  off  last  year.  The  subject  has  been  much  discussed  during  the  fortnight,  and  we  ob- serve that  at  the  other  presidencies  as  well  as  here  the  opinion  finds  very  general  acceptance  that  from  some  unknown  cause  the  Government  of  India  must  be  em- barrassed in  their  finances,  and  that  the  loan  is  the  re- sult of  this  emergency.  Money  continues  in  improved  demand,  and  we  do  not  look  for  an  easier  market  for  some  time.  Government  securities  and  joint-stock  shares  are  in  little  request,  and  our  quotations  generally  show  lower  figures.  In  the  general  position  of  our  inport  market  there  is  little  to  be  remarked  since  our  last  circular  ;  the  de- pression we  then  had  occasion  to  notice  has  in  no  way  been  alleviated  ;  on  the  contrary,  the  dealers  have  shown  less  desire  to  emtead  their  liabilities,  consequently  the  market  has  been  very  dull,  and  prices  of  cotton  fabrics  we  quote  .  q  l  u  4  ot  a  e  .  2  t  r  e  .  1  4r  2  .  a.  ;  71b.  56  ;  w  hi  le  in  have  further  retrograded,  the  very  f  avourable  rate  of  exchange  on  London  being  the  ind  ucement  to  press  sales,  but  without  leading  to  any  extent  of  business.

Freight—To  Great  Britain  had  a  very  dull  appearance  at  one  time,  and  little  was  shipping  at  3/.  10s.  per  ton  of  50  feet,  but  as  produce  is  in  greater  quantity  now,  and  tonnage  moderate,  rates  of  freight  have  a  hardening  tendency.

(From  fhe  Englishman.)  THURSDAY,  March  22.—The  Oriental  is  at  hand,  but  her  letters  will  be  delivered  too  late  to  affect  our  markets  for  this  mail  ;  by  electric  telegrap  from  Bombay  we  have  Lond  on  news  to  the  9th  of  Febrh  uary,  Which  se  ems  to  hold  out  s  till  l  ess  hopes  of  peace  than  before  c  existed  but  uncertainty  i  s  the  pervading  feeling,  and  conse- quently matters  have  not  improved.  The  state  of  the  money-market,  as  well  as  an  advance  i  n  both  .  freight  and  exchange,  bay  kept'  all  produce  operations  upon  a  very  low  scale  ;  the  total  of  onr  ex- ports, in  money  value,  is  fast  AOW  tha  t  bulk  of  the  indigo  has  been  shipped.  Rice,  seeds,  and  jute  do  not  amount  to  much,  and  our  cargoes  are  now  mainly  composed  of  these  articles.  The  hopes  w  e  indulged  in  at  the  date  of  our  last  as  to  more  active  business  in  piece  goods  have  not  been  rea- lized.; at  first  some  little  distrust  with  regard  to  one  or  two  extensive  dealers  and  the  occurrence  of  native  holy- days disturbed  business  ;  and  in  the  following  week  the  complete  upset  the  money-market  sustained  paralyzed  all  operations,  for,  as  no  one'could-  tell  who  might  be  affected,  current  orders  were  placed  in  abeyance,  arri  literally  everything  stands  still  ;  holden,  desirous  of  re- mitting to  their  constituent;  are  pledging  goods  (in  the  bonded  warehouse)  to  the  banks  fir  bills  on  Landon,  paying  interest  at  12  per  cent.  per  annum  and  a  com- mission besides  ;  bow  these  goods  can  ever  bear  the  bur- den remains  to  be  seen  ;  but  ,  the  course,  after  all,  is  pro- bably the  best  the  parties  can  follow  under  so  perfect  a  state  of  stagnation.  Exchange—At  the  close  of  our  last  the  tendency  ap- peared rather  to  be  downward,  but  the  rates  for  this  mail,  owing  to  the  extreme  tigbtness  of  the  money- market keeping  buyers  back,  opened  rather  higher,  and  those  requiring  to  draW  were  obliged  to  do  so  at  ad- vanced rates.  Credits  were  early  done  at  2s.  11d.,  and  document  bills  at  2s.  10.  The  Oriental.  Bank  drew  at  six  months'  sight  at  28.1  d.  We  hear  that  parties  who  con- sidered this  rise  as  merely  temporary  took  a  !oan  on  de- posit of  their  credit  bills  with  a  bank,  at  12  per  cent.  inte- rest and  a  commission  on  the  transaction.  It  is  SA  difficult  to  get  in  money  from  the  piece  goods  men  that  there  are  few  buyers  in  the  market,  and  the  banks  consequently,  have  it  all  their  own  way  ;  we  believe  the  bulk  of  the  transactions  for  this  mail  have  been  at  2s.  11d.  to  lid.  for  credits  and  2s.  11d.  to  lid.  for  document  bills  at  six  months'  sight,  although  at  closing  the  rates  .may  be  a  trifle  .  dearer.  Treasury  and  Bank  Post  Bills  are  quoted  at  2s.  Ad.  to  2s.  4d.  On  China  the  rate  is  212  r.  per  100  ~.-  Y  reighta.,—The  rise.  which  -wit  advised  in•our  commencing  continued  during  the  following  week,  and  the  telegraph  from  Bombay  reporting  rice  as  up  to  18s.  created  an  immense  demand  for  tonnage,  which  for  a  day  or  two.  forced  rates  up  probably,  equal.  to  11.  per  ton  on  some  articles,  but  the  value  of  money  told  against  business,  and  rates  declined  again  ;  and  at  clos- ing we  think  scarcely  so  firm.  We  quote  for  Len- don—Sugar, 41.  10s.  to  4/.  15s.  ;  saltpetre,  nominal  ;  rice,  51.  to  51.  2s.  6d.  ;  seeds,  61.  to  61.  ss.  ;  jute,  41.  to  4/.  4s.  ;  hides,  Si.  ss,  ;,  silk  and  indigo,  61.  ;  other  goods  in  like  proportion.

On  business  being  resumed  after  the  China  new  year  (the  17th  ult.)  there  was  ,  a  better  disposition  evinced  among  dealers  to  make  purchases,  but  the  transactions  in  imports  for  the  past  month  have  still  been  on  a  very  limited  scale.

The  Edinburgh  County  Militia,  now  styled  the  Queen's  was,  on  Wednesday  last,  paraded  at  Dalkeith  for  volunteering,  when  upwards  of  90  men  fell  out,  upwards  of  80  of  whom  have  passed  and  been  attested  for  the  Scots  Greys,  the  25th  Foot,  and  the  72d  Highlanders.  This  regiment  has  already  contributed  275  volunteers  to  the  line,  and  yet  presents  a  very  respectable  appearance.  About  60  recruits  'have  been  received  within  the  la  ,  t  fortnight.  The  deputation  of  the  inhabitants  of  Dalkeith  who  went  to  London  to  complain  of  the  regiment  being  billetted  on  the  town  have  received  the  promise  of  the  War-office  that  they  will  be  removed  forthwith  to  Edinburgh  Castle.  The  2d  Royal  Lanark  Militia  was  inspected  a  few  days  ago  by  Major-General  Lord  Melville,  who  expressed  himself  highly  satisfied  with  the  state  in  which  he  found  the  regiment.  In  the  evening  the  officers  gave  a  grand  hall,  at  which  were  present—the  Duke  and  Duchess  of  Hamilton,  the  Duke  of  Athol,  Lord  Melville,  &amp;c.  On  Friday  the  second  volunteerinc  ,  took  place,  when  about  150  men  stepped  out  of  the  ranks,  and  92  were  enlisted,  making  upwards  of  180  given  since  July,  of  whom  more  than  three-fourths  are  for  the  92d  and  72d.  This  regi- ment has  now  enlisted  more  than  1,030  men.  The  buts  on  Lanark-moor  cannot  be  ready  till  May,  in  consequence  of  the  lateness  of  the  season.  A  detach- ment is  expected  to  go  to  Airdrie.  WAREHOUSEMEN  AND  CLERKS'  SCHOOLS  -ANNUAL  DINNER.  The  annual  dinner  in  aid  of  the  funds  of  this  valuable  charity  took  place  yesterday  evening  at  the  London  Tavern,  under  the  presidency  of  Lord  John  Russell,  and  was  most  numerously  attended.  The  great  additional  number  of  guests  required  a  complete  re-adjustment  of  the  arrangements  of  the  banquet  hall,  but  happily  every  one  was  ultimately  comfortably  seated,  and  in  conse- quence of  the  excellent  organisation  of  the  establish- ment, every  one  was  also  abundantly  served  and  satis- fied. The  recent  uncourteous  reception  of  the  noble  chairman  at  the  Guildhall  seemed  to  be  in  every  one's  mind,  and  a  determination  was  evinced  at  an  early  pe- riod of  the  evening  to  show  his  lordship,  that  whatever  might  be  the  hostility  which  his  political  conduct  had  engendered  in  the  breasts  of  the  citizens  generally,  it  was  by  no  means  shared  by  the  warehousemen  and  clerks,  who  only  recognised  in  their  president  a  man  of  high  station  and  influence  c  ming  forward  to  aid  by  his  presence  the  cause  of  this  infant  but  valuable  and  pro- mising charity.  The  noble  lord  was  cheered  tremen- dously on  entering  the  room,  and  subsequently  at  various  periods  of  the  evening,  when  the  order  of  the  proceed.  ings  brought  him  more  prominently  before  the  meeting.  Amongst  the  heads  of  the  warehousing  trade  who  sup•  ported  his  lordship  at  the  head  table  were  Messrs.  Geo.  Moore,  Win.  Leaf,  J.  P.  Foster,  Watford,  Greatorex,  George  Laurance,  W.  J.  Powell,  W.  Bradbury,  &amp;c.  Upwards  of  two  hundred  gentlemen  sat  down  to  dinner.  A  musical  party  under  the  direction  of  Mr.  Ransford,  and  comprising  the  talents  of  Misses  Ransford  and  Eyles,  Messrs.  Genge  and  W.  E.  Ransford,  were  in  at- tendance, and  performed  a  selection  of  popular  music  in  the  course  of  the  evening.  L.,rd  J.  Russell  appeared  to  be  in  the  best  health  and  spirits,  and  addressed  himself  to  the  business  of  the  evening  with  commendable  care  and  earnestness.  The  first  toast  was  The  Queen  of  whom  the  Chairman  said,  that  many  years'  experience  of  her  Ma- jesty's public  and  private  virtues  only  served  to  increase  the  affectionate  attachment  of  the  British  people  towards  their  Sover,  ign.  (Loud  cheers.)  The  next  toast  was  Prince  Albert,  the  Prince  of  Wales,  and  the  rest  of  the  royal  Of  the  Prince  of  Wales  the  Chairman  observed  that  he  had  reached  his  fourteenth  year,  and  was  now  approaching  a  period  of  his  life  when  the  nation  would  appreciate  the  excel- lent education  he  had  received.  (Hear,  hear,  and  cheers.)  Lord  J.  Russell  trusted  that  in  future  times  his  Royal  Highness  would  became  an  honour  to  his  country,  and  to  those  who  had  had  the  charge  of  his  education.  (Cheers.)  The  CHAIRMAN  again  rose  to  give  Army  and  He  said  he  was  then  about  to  give  a  toast  which  had  often  been  drunk  in  time  of  peace  ,  eith  a  prophetic  anticipation  of  the  services  which  the  army  and  navy  would  be  ready  to  perform  whenever  war  should  arise.  (lieu.)  He  had  now  to  give  it  with  the  assurance  that  all  that  could  have  been  expected  of  our  gallant  army  and  navy  had  been  gallantly  performed.  (Cheers.)  They  must  all  bo  proud  of  that  army  which,  being  only  as  numerous  as  the  country  could  fit  out  at  the  first  out- break of  the  war,  had  still  at  Alma  performed  the  most  daring  feats,  and  had  carried  these  positions  in  three  hours  which  it  was  expected  would  have  resisted  for  three  weeks.  (Cheers.)  They  would  also  remember  that,  when  that  army  bad  been  reduced  by  disease  and  priva- tion of  every  kind—by  cold,  and  want  of  food,  and  clothing—they  fought  the  world-famous  battle  of  Joker- man, and  against  six  times  their  number  gloriously  sus- tained the  honour  of  the  British  flog.  (Cheers.)  But,  however  much  they  might  admire  the  daring  of  those  who  fought  their  battles,  he  begged  to  observe  that  the  innate  courage  and  power  of  discipline  that  enabled  men,  day  after  day,  and  night  after  night,  to  sustain  the  hard- ships of  the  trenches  without  the  inspiring  chance  of  en- countering the  enemy  face  to  face,  but  still  in  momentary  daug-r  of  his  rifles  and  artillery,  was  equally  worthy  of  their  admiration.  (Cheers.)  Hewever  great  might  have  been  the  courage  of  those  who,  battled  in  the  field,  the  soldiers  of  the  trenches  had  also  set  an  example  which  he  hoped  might  be  worthily  emulated  in  future  times.  (Hear.)  They  had  recently  had  to  rejoice  in'  the  fall  of  Sebastopol,  the  object  of  all  these  bateiles  and  perils.  That  stronghold  which  heel  been  supposed  to  be  impreg- nable was  now  the  prize  of  the  allied  armies,  and  they  had  further  to  rejoice  that  while  the  British  troops  bore  the  brunt  at  the  battles  at  Alma  and  lektr- loan, their  allies,  the  French  and  Sardinians,  had  won  the  b  a  ttl  e  of  the  Tchernaya,  and  finally  taken  &amp;bast  ;poi.  He  trusted  that  the  union  consummated  by  the  aseault  on  Sebastopol,  might  be  only  the  pr  sage  of  a  long  and  enduring  alliance  between  the  to  o  countries.  (Cheers.)  He  might,  he  hoped,  be  permitted,  as  one  who  had  long  known  him,  to  lament  that  the  gallant  spirit  of  Raglan  bad  lied  before  the  final  triumph  had  arrived,  for  he  was  sure  that  all  the  wise  measures  his  departed  friend  had  taken,  all  the  firmness  he  had  displayed,  merited  the  re  ward  of  participating  in  the  final  victory.  But  the  examples  furnished  by  men  like  him  would  not  be  lost  ;  they  would  be  preserved  to  future  generations,  and  would  show  in  what  school  England  brought  up  her  soldiers,  and  what  pupils  the  great  Duke  of  Wellington  had  trained.  (Cheers.)  With  regard  to  the  navy,  their  gallantry  was  too  well  known  to  require  any  eulogium  from  him.  It  must  be  a  disappointment  to  them  that  they  had  net  had  an  opportunity  of  meeting  the  enemy's  fleets  in  hostile  array  ;  bat  still,  in  every  operation  in  which  th  ey  had  been  engaged,  in  the  Sea  of  Azuff,  and  at  Kinb  aurn,  they  had  displayed  all  their  character  i  st  i  c  gallantry.  an  d  if  ever  the  enemy  should  encounter  t  h  em  ,  they  wou  ld  no  doubt  give  as  good  an  account  of  t  h  e  struggle  as  th  e  y  had  in  former  times.  (Cheers.)  With  these  few  words  he  would  propose  The  Army  and  Navy  but  he  could  not  sit  down  without  alluding  to  the  conduct  of  our  brave  allies  the  Turks  at  Silistria,  and  more  recently  at  Kars—where  they  had  shown  that,  with  good  officers,  they  were  fit  to  rank  with  the  first  soldiers  in  the  world.  (Hear,  hear.)  Major  Woon,  as  an  officer  of  forty  years'  standing,  returned  thanks  for  the  army.  Seeing  so  many  ladies  in  the  gallery  reminded  him  of  the  invaluable  services  which  a  lady,  Miss  Nightingale,  had  rendered  to  our  sick  and  wounded  soldiers  in  the  East.  (Cheers.)  The  CHAIRMAN  in  rising  to  propose  the  toast  of  the  evening,  Prosperity  to  the  Warehousemen  and  Clerks  said  that  it  would  not  be  necessary  to  waste  many  words  in  advancing  the  cause  of  charity  and  be- nevolence, which  was  what  had  brought  them  together  on  that  evening.  He  begged  leave  in  a  few  words  to  call  their  attention  to  the  rapid  growth  of  the  institution.  It  appeared  that  in  December,  1853,  the  first  suggestion  was  made  of  providing  for  the  orphans  and  necessitous  children  of  warehousemen  and  clerks,  and  in  less  than  six  weeks  3,0001.  was  raised  by  the  young  men  them- seives for  the  purpose  of  founding  the  institution.  and  cheers.)  A  short  time  after,  the  princi- pals, finding  that  it  had  been  taken  up  with  so  much  spirit,  came  forward,  and  in  gifts  of  501.  or  1001.  sub- scribed the  large  total  of  4,0001.  (Hear,  hear.)  It  ap- peared further  that  after  a  short  time  the  subscriptions  had  so  much  augmented,  that  after  one  of  their  public  dinners  no  less  a  sum  than  10,0001.  was  funded,  an  annual  income  of  1,0001.  ascertained,  and  a  balance  left  at  the  bankers'  of  8301.  Fifteen  children  had  already  been  admitted  and  six  more  were  about  to  be  elected,  making  21  in  all,  who  would  be  provided  for  through  the  exertions  of  the  association.  In  addition  to  that,  ground  had  been  obtained,  and  they  would  shortly  have  a  building  of  their  own  for  their  permanent  establish- ment. Having  stated  these  facts,  he  would  only  say  that  an  institution  which  had  been  so  auspiciously  begun,  and  which  had  increased  so  rapidly,  and  comprehending  so  large  a  class  as  the  warehousemen  and  clerks  of  the  wholesale  dealers  of  this  country,  could  not  long  remain  without  experiencing  a  very  great  extension.  (Hear  ,  hear.)  He  expected  that  in  a  few  years  the  schools  would  be  largely  augmented,  and  that  those  who  through  their  industry  and  talent  had  become  fortunate  in  the  world  would  not  forget  to  contribute  something  towards  the  support  of  the  orphan  children  of  those  who  had  not  been  so  fortunate  as  themselves—(cheers)  —and  thus  save  their  comrades  that  pang  which  h  e  believed  was  the  bitterest  in  life,  that  of  fearing  t  ha  t  failing  health  would  oblige  them  to  leave  theirchildren  who  destitute  on  the  world.  He  appealed  tc_l_  thosewould  tell  them  that  there  was  not  a  were  engaged  in  the  business  of-  life,  and  .  cheering  or  con- solatory reflection  than  that  had  helped  to  maintain  institutions  like  the  present  by  more  ey  c  their  ass%tance  and  charity,  (Rear.)

A  SUPP  already  become  nsost  conti2uouS  in-the  improved  cultivation  and  extended  resources  of  the  distant  marts  of  the  empire.  Nor  have  the  moral  and  social  effects  of  the  increased  facilities  of  communication  been  less  important,  or  less  conducive  to  human  happiness.  By  reducing  to  a  -  third  the  expense,  and  to  a  fourth  the  time  of  travelling,  they  have  extended  its  benefits  to  a  proportionally  wider  circle,  and,  sir  particular,  brought  them  within  the  ,  reach  of  the  middle  class,  to  whom  they  were  previously  alMost  unknown.  A  tradesman  or  mechaniecan  now  make  -  •  the  tour  of  the  British  Islands,  or  even  of  Europe,  in  a  few  days,  which  formerly  was  never  attempted  but  by  the  nobility,  and.  accomplished  in  as  many  years.  Immense  has  been  the  effect  of.  this  happy  facility,  alike  in  dispelling  prejudice,  refining  manners,  and  improving  taste  ;  and  these  changes  have  powerfully  reacted  upon  capital  cities.  It  is  from  the  railway  system,  and  the  desires  to  which  it  gave  rise  among  a  new  and  wide  circle,  •that  the  Great  Exhibition  of  London  in  1851,  the  subsequent  ones  at  New  York  and  Paris,  and  the  glorious  Crystal  Palace  at  Sydenham,  haVe  taken  their  rise.  In  a  political  point  of  view,  the  effects  of  the  railway  system  have  been  not  less  important.  By  bringing  the  distant  pro- vinces of  our  empire,  comparatively  speaking,  into  close  proximity  WithThe.metropolis,  it  has  augmented  their  intelli- gence, and  in  the  same  proportion  increased  their  political  power.  The  constant  intercourse  from  travelling,  the  in- creased facility  for  the  transmission  of  books  and  newspapers,  the  almost  instantaneous  transmission  of  intelligence  by  the  electric  telegraph,  which  soon  after  followed,  have  powerfully  contributed-  to  equalise  the  advantages  of  situation,  and  give  to  the  provinces  a  large  portion,  if  not  the  whole,  ,of  the  intellectual  activity  which  formerly  was  peculiar  to  the  metropolis.-  By  enabling  troops  or  police  to  he  sent  rapidly  from  one  part  of  the  country  to  another,  it  has  aug- mented the  efficiency  of  the  central  government,  and  enabled  it  to  provide  with  fewer  men.  and  at  a  less  cost,  both  for  defence  against  external  enemies,  and  the  maintenance  of  domestic  tranquillity..  That  worst  of  all  ascendancies  in  a  community,  the  sway  of  the  mob  of  the  capital  over  the  legis- lature, 'from  the  mere  force  of  proximity  of  situation,  so  fatally  experienced  in  Athens,  Rome,  and  Paris,  has  been  in  a  great  measure  destroyed.  A  more  striking  proof  of  this  cannot  be  figurod  than  was  furnished  by  the  fact,  that  when  the  disarmament  of  the  National  Guard  in  Belleville  and  Montmartre  was  carried  into  execution,  after  the  suppression  of  the  great  insurrection  in  July.  1848,  it  was  effected  by  the  National  Guards  of  La  Vend6e,  brought  up  by  the  Orleans  Railway  from  that  distant  and  secluded  province.  There  is  no  unmixed  good  in  human  affairs.  Advantages,  how  great  soever,  are  invariably  attended  by  corresponding  evils.  The  railway  system  is  no  exception  to  this  general  rule;  on  the  contrary,  it  affords  one  of  the  most  striking  illustrations  of  it.  It  is  the  greatest  promoter  that  ever  came  into  operation  .4:4  the  centralising  systed,  ;  but  it  has  induced  its  evils  as  well  as  its.  advantages.  As  much  as  it  has  brought  the  physical  force  of  the  prOvinces  to  the  supPOrt  of  govern.  meat  in  the  capital,'  hai  it  brought  the  intellectual  influence  of  the  metropolis  down  to  the  provinces.  The  chief  talent  of  the  nation  being  there  concentrated,  from  the  objects  of  ambition,  political,  literary,  or  legal,  which  are  presented,  the  sway  a  mind  in  a  particular  quarter  has  become  well  nigh  irresistible.  The  empire  has  become  a  huge  metropolis,  which  the  London  press  rules  with  despotic  sway.  Originality  or  independence  Of  thOught  in  the  provinces  is  crushed  in  all  save  a  few  intrepid  minds,  by  the  overwhelming  weight  of  the  capital.  Norhas  the  material  and  political  influence  of  great  cities  been  less  increased  by,the  change  than  their  intellectual  sway.  The  facility  of  reachine.  themet  metropolis  has  caused  the  great  and  the  affluent  to  tra  n  sf  er  nearly  all  their  purchases  to  London;  the  attraction  s  o  f  Manchester,  Birmingham,  Liver- pool, and  Glasgow,  have  drawn  the  most  part  of  the  purchases  of  the  middle  classes  in  the  provinces  to  these  great  empo- riums of  wealth  and  industry.  The  l  small  towns  have  dwindled  or  become  stationary.  because.  They  r  v  e  lo  los  s  t  their  purchasers  ;  the  great  ones  have  swelled  int  i  o  e.  Ba  .  n  •because  they  have  tripled  theirs.  Politically  .  speaking,  change  has  been  of  incalculable  importance.  The  landed  proprietors  have  ceased  to  Infliteno  the  small  boroughs,  because  all  their  purchases  ure  made  in  the  great  ones,  or.  the  metropolis.  The  great  ma- nufacturing towns  have  become  the  rulers,  because  it  is  from  them  that  the  employment  which  feeds  the  lesser  towns  flows  The  only  influence  Which  can  be  reckoned  on  as  durable  is  that  which  gives  bread  or  employment.  When  it  is  recollected  that  three  fifths  of  the  House  of  Commons  consist  of  the  members  for  boroughs,  it  may  be  conceived  how  important  an  influence  this  change  has  .  come  to  have  -on  the  balance  of  parties  in  the  state,  .  -  Experience  has  not  yet  enabled  us  to  determine  what  influ- ence the  railway  system,  when  generally  introduced,  is  fitted  to  have  on  military  operations—the  attack  or  defence  of  nations;  for  the  only  greatwars  which  have  taken  place  since  its  introduction—viz;,  those  in  Italy  and  Hungary  in  1819,  Kid  Turkey  in  1854—took  place  in  cpuntries  where  it  had  not  been  at  ail,  or  only  partially  introduced.  It  is  usually  consi- &amp;red as  having  strengthened  the  means  of  defence  rather  than  attack,  by  facilitating  ,  the  concentration  of  troops.  which  it  certainly  does,  on  the  men  aced  point.  Yet  must  -  this  be  taken  with  some  limitations  ;  for  if  it  facilitates  the  concen- tration of  the  defending,  it  in  an  equal  degree  aids  the  accu- mulation of  the  attacking  force:  if  it  will  bring  the  military  -strength  of  all  France  in  three  days  to  the  menaced  point  in  Belgium  or  the  Rhine,  it  will  not  less  certainly  bring  the  whole  invading  force  of  Germany  in  as  short  a  time,to  the  same  point.  If  generally  introduced  into  Russia.  it  would  double  the  already  overgrown  military  strength  of  the  Czar,  ty  more  than  halving  the  distance  which  his  troopS  have  to  march,  and  rendeing  tine  translation  of  them  from  the  .ttaltie  ,EM  ENT  TO  THE  LIVERPOOL,  STAN  'to  the  Eu±ine,  or'  from  Poland  to  the  Caucasus,  the  Worli  of  a  few  days  only,  and-of  no  fatigue  or  loss  to  the  mets.  Undoubtedly,  however,  upon  the  whole,  it  favours  the  arms  of  Civilisation  in  a  contest  with  barbarism  ;  for  it  re- quires an  effort  of  skill  and  expenditure  of  capital  for  its  general  adoption  which  can  only  be'looked'for  in  a  wealthy,  and  enlightened  state:  If  it  is  equally  adopted  by  two  coun- tries in  a  similar  state  of  civilisation,  as  France  and  Germany,  and  3uffered  to  exist  ;  it  may  cause  war  to•  resemble  'more  closely  a  game  at  chess,  by  enabling  the  players  to  make  ,  the  moves  at  pleasure.  But  if  one,  when  invaded,  has  the  courage  or  the  patriotic  spirit  to  break  up  the  system,  it  may  give  a  very  great,  perhaps  a  decisive  advantage,  to  the  party  making  the  sacrifice;  for  if  the  retiring  army  tears  up  the  railway  lines  and  breaks  down  the  bridges,  it  retains  the  advantages  of  the  system  to  itself,  and  takes  them  away  from  its  'oppo- nent. In  this  way  it  may  be  rendered  an  essential  element  in  the  defence,  and  important  in  maintaining  the  independ- ence of  nations.  Probably,  to  take  advantage  of  it,  fortresses  wilt  come  hereafter  to  be  constructed  in  the  heart  'rather  than  the  frontiers  of  kingdoms,  in  order  that  an  invading  enemy  may  find  his  own  facilities  diminish,  and  the  forces  of  his  adversary  increase  as  he  approaches  the  centre  of  his  power.  HaVing  so  disposed  of  the  past,  the  present,  and  the  future  of  the  railway;  that  great  instrument  of  civil- isation and  human  improvement,  the  historian  next  proceeds  with  a  consideration  of  those  causes  which  immediately  led  to  passing  the  lleforni  Bill  of  1832,  and  in  doing  this  he  is  necessarily  i  m  p  e  ll  e  d  t  o  a  n  exa- mination of  the  public  character  and  history  of  the  leading  men  by  whom  that  great  change  was  brought  about.  In  discharge  of  this  portion  of  his  historical  labours,  Sir  Archibald  passes  in  masterly  review  the  political  and  moral  characters  of  the“Toremost  in  that  important  movement.  Strong  inclination  prompts  us  to  quote  some  of  those  admirable  sketches,  which  want  of  space  prevents  us  doing  -  more  than  briefly  alluding  to.  In  his  delineation  of  these  -  charac- ters, .our  author  displays  some  and  not  a  feW  of  his  best  qualities—in  them  he  manifests  clear  sagacity  coupled  with  irreproachable  candour,  sharp  p  ene  t  ra  ti  on  is  backed  by  sou  n  d  .  judgment,  inflexible  justice  and  stern  honesty  of  purpose  are  'counterpoised  though  not  controlled  by  gentleness  of  disposition,  and  in  every  instance  he  exhibits  an  anxious  desire  to  nothinc  ,  extenuate.  Nor  set  down  aught  in  and  this  •  strong  earnestness  renders  the  intellectual  portraits  he  has  produced  as  tributary  to  his  moral  worth  as  they  are  creditable  to  his  mental  character,  and  honourable  to  that  literature  of  which  he  forms-at  once  a  pillar  and  an  ornament.  Instead  of  seeming  more  encumbered  by  difficulties  as  he  approaches  the  period  of  his  labours,  the  task  appears  easier  to  Sir  Archibald,  as  he  approximates  towards  its  completion  :  a.  sure  .  indication  •  that  the  work  has  been  well  considered  in  all  its  complicated  bearings.  As  in  any  carefully-designed  undertaking,  each  succeeding  step  in  its  progress  tends  more  and  more  to  illustrate  thpse  which  have  preceded,  while  it  also  gives  more  intelli- gible token  of  ;the  form  and  colour  to  be  assumed  by  those  which  are  to  follow.  In  short,  working  to  a  pre-conceived  and  well-digested  plan,  the  perfect  sym- metry of  proportion,  the  entire  harmony  of  parts,  and  the  complete  homogeneousness  of  the  structure  become  more  obvious  as  it  approaches  completion,  and  will  not  be  fully  developed,  till  it  is  finished  in  all  its  noble  pro- portions and  details  of  tall  pinnacle  and  strengthening  buttress.  of  charming  colonnade,  rich  frieze,  and  well- proportioned cornice.  -  Blackwood's  Magazine.

METHOD.—AII  things  in  us  and  about  us  are  a  chaos  with- out method  ;  and  so  long  as  the  mind  is  entirely)  passive,  so  long  as  there  is  an  habitual  submission  of  the  understanding  to  mere  events  and  images,  as  such,,  without  any  attempt  to  classify  and  arrange  them,  so  long  the  chaos  must  continue.  There  may  be  transition,  but  there  never'  cai  be  progress  ;  there  may  be  sensation,  but  there  cannot  be  thought  ;  for  the  total  absence  of  method  renders  things  impracticable  ;  as  we  think  that  partial  defects  of  method  proportionally  render  thinking  a  trouble  and  a  fatigue.—S.

SWALLOWING  A  WRIT.—In  Newington  Church  is  buried  .  Mr.  Serjeant  Davy  (d.  1660.)  He  was  originally  a  chemist  of  Exeter;  and  a  sheriff's  officer  coming  to  serve  on  him  a  pro- cess from  the  Court  of  Common  Pleas,  he  civilly  asked  him  to  drink,  While  the  man  was  drinking,  Davy  contrived  to  heat  a  poker,  and  then  told  the  bailiff  that  if  he.  did  not  eat  the  writ,  which  was  of  sheepskin,  and  as  good  as  mutton,  he  should  swallow  the  poker  !  The  man  preferred  the  parchment  ;  but  the  Court  of  Common  Pleas,  not  then  accustomed  to  Mr.  Davy's  jokes,  sent  for  him  to  estminster  Hall,  and  for  con- tempt of  their  process  committed  him  to.  Fleet  prison.  From  this  circumstance,  and  some  unfortunate  .man  whom  he  met  there,  he  acquired  a  taste  of  the  l  a  w,  and  on.  his  discharge  he  applied  himself  to  the  study  in  earnest,  was  called  to  the  bar,  made  a  serjeant,  and  was  for  a  long  time  in  good  practice.—  Timb's  Curiosities  of  London.

The  cavalcade  extended  six  leagues  in  length,  and  the  trump  ets  of  the  van  were  sounding  at  the  gate  of  Alcala  De  Henares,  the  first  day's  halting-place,  ere  the  last  files  had  issued  from  the  gate  of  Madrid.—Stirling's  Velazquez.  EPISODE  IN  THE  LIFE  OF  LOUIS  NAPOLEON.  —  It  was  on  the  occasion  of  a  dramatic  representation  at  the  St.  James's  Theatre,  some  time  in  the  month  of  June,  1847,  that  the  inci- dent to  which  I  allude  took  place.  It  was  a  royal  night,  and  the  Queen  and  Prince  Albert  occupied  the  royal  box.  By  their  side  sat  the  Duke  of  Nemours—not  then  an  exile  eating  the  bitter  bread  of  foreign  hospitality,  but  the  offspring  of  a  reigning  king,  the  future  regent  of  a  great  country,  the  near  connection  of  the  sovereign  who;  in  the  sunshine  of  his  suc- cess, gave  him  so  gracious  a  welcome  to  the  English  court.  Below,  however,  the  scene  was  less  flattering  to  the  theory  of  the  divine  right  of  kings.  On  one  side  sat  the  Duke  of  Bruns- wick, with  his  diamonds  and  rouge,  an  exile  from  his  beloved  on  the  other,  and  opposite  him,  the  Count  of  Montemolin,  the  pretender  to  the  Spanish  throne.  In  the  first  tier  of  boxes,  concealed  by  the  drapery,  and  shrouded,  as  it  were,  with  the  shadow  of  misfortunes,  sat  the  dethroned  brother  of  Don  Pedro—Don  Miguel  himself  ;  and  nothing  was  wanting  to  the  tableau  of  the  defunct  sovereigns  and  ousted  pretenders  but  the  presence  of  the  culminating  Theodorns  of  the  scene.—  Every  one  was  making  comments  on  the  strange  coincidence  that  had  brought  so  many  claimants  of  royalty  together  into  one  spot,  and  smiling  at  the  ,mutability  of  things,  when  sud- denly, by  the  orchestra,  entered  Louis  Napoleon.  The  situa- tion was  striking.  There  was  nothing  to  break  its  effect,  as  the  curtain  was  down,  and  every  'one  was  yielding  to  the  train  of  thoughts  naturally  engendered  ,  by  the  spectacle.  A  Sense  of  ridicule  seized  on  the  whole  assembly;  a  laugh  passed  from  the  orchestra  through  the  pit,  even  to  the  royal  box.  The  very  name  of  Louis  Napoleon  seemed  to  warrant  a  smile—- a smile  at  the  folly  of  the  hero  of  Strasbourg  and  Boulogne.  Louis  Napoleon  was  not  slow  to  undertand  the  object  of  so  much  merriment.  He  threw  a  cold  and  sullen  glance  on  the  royal  box,  where  the  Duke  of  Nemours,  the  son  of  the  king  of  the  French,  sat  in  smiling  mockery  at  the  luckless  aspirant  to  his  father's  throne  ;  and  then  rising  from  his  seat,  he  slowly  and  deliberately  placed  himself  on  the  left  side  of  the  theatre,  under  that  royal  box,  and  in  such  a  manner  as  to  break  the  view  of  its  inmates..  What  were  his  feelings  at  the  moment  !  Now  that  we  know  the  man,  we  can  fancy,  at  least,  somewhat  of  the  bitternees  which  must  have  overswept  his  heart,  when  thus  treated  as  the  subject  of  general  ridicule  by  a  large  and  crowded  audience—when  thus  mocked  by  the  successful  rival  of  his  fortunes  and  smiled  at  by  the  sovereign  in  whose  lands  he  was  an  exile.  We  can  fancy  somewhat  of  the  dark  shadows  and  the  tangled  passions,  raid  the  impenetrable  throbbings  of  vengeance  and  hate,  which  must  have  then  possessed  the  soul  of  the  exile  of  King-street—the  present  Emperor  of  France,  and  the  late  guest  of  Queen  Victoria.—Chambers's  Journal.

COURTENAY,  Member  of  the  Royal  College  of  Surgeons  of  England.  We  believe  Mr.  Courtenay's  experience  in  the  treatment  of  stric- ture during  the  last  twenty  years  has  equalled,  if,  indeed,  it  has  not  surpassed,  that  of  any  of  his  contemporaries.  It  is,  therefore,  no  matter  of  surprise  that  he  should  enjoy  the  reputation  of  being  a  most  dexterous  and  skilfhl  manipulator  with  urethral  instruments  ;  and  when  it  is  remembered  that  the  lamented  Liston  used  to  assert  that  the  introduction  of  Instruments  through  a  stricture  which  bad  previously  been  impermeable  to  them,  was  the  most  difficult  in  the  whole  range  of  surgical  operations,  it  must  be  no  slight  source  of  gratification  on  Mr.  Courtenay's  part,  to  have  achieved  the  reputation  ho  has  in  this  respect  ;  and  for  our  part,  with  the  knowledge  we  have  of  his  experience,  we  know  of  no  man  to  whose  care  we  would  with  greater  confidence  entrust  the  treatment  of  a  severe  case  of  stricture  of  the  Circular.  ttliT  ~  E  STABLISHED  1837.

TAKEN—The  plans  of  operation  not  being  made  public,  but  a  general  impression  existing  that  successful  measures  will  soon  be  adopted,  it  is  the  north  and  wintery  side  of  the  Russian  fortifications  which  will  next  fall  before  the  Allies,  and  furnish  another  instance  of  military  skill  and  perseverance.  The  attack  on  the  south  has  Bacceeded,  and  the  surrender  of  the  forts  has  revealed  valuable  mill.  tary  provisions.  By  the  force  of  comparison  every  one  will  perceive  the  analogy  between  these  circumstances  and  the  business  of  E.  MOSES  and  SON.  The  success  of  their  summer  campaign  has  been  fully  attested,  and  has  revealed  the  vast  commercial  forces  they  command.  The  light,  the  waterproof,  the  attractive,  and  the  gen- tlemanly garments,  which  have  been  so  approved,  have  risen  above  all  criticism,  and  left  every  one  vocal  in  praise  of  the  generalship  of  E.  Mesas  and  Sox.  The  Autumn  and  Winter  season  approaches  ;  the  opponents  of  personal  cdmfort  must  again  be  combatted  ;  the  resources  are  ample  and  the  arrangements  complete.

There  is  a  verisimilitude  about  it  that  would  -  entitle  it  to  attention  at  any  moment  or  on  any  authority.  The  difficulty  hitherto  has  been  how  the  noblemen  above  alluded  to,  and  some  others  holding  high  office,  have  consented  to  sustain,  by  their  popularity,  experience,  and  talent,  the  blun- dering incapacity  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  same  of  his  highly-favoured  colleagues.  Although  hat- ing a  party  altogether  consisting  of  officers,  and  numerically  inferior  .  to  any  in  the  House  or  in  the  country,  he  has  continued  to  monopolise  fcr  his  immediate  followers  all  the  offices  relating  to  the  conduct  of  the  War—the  mismanagement  whereof  has  cast  the  deepest  disgrace  upon  the  collective  body.  The  Whig  portion  of  the  Cabinet  cannot,  so  long  as  they  consent  to  act  with  the  Peelites,  escape  £rom  a  portion  of  the  blame.  The  nation  sees  that  it  is  the  duty  of  those,  in  whom  it  still  feels  some  degree  of  confidence,  to  shake  off  the  unholy  alliance  without  further  loss  of  time,  and,  if  they  cannot  see  their  views  fairly  carried  into  operation,  to  sever  the  connection.  It  is  by  their  strength  only  that  LordABzRDEEN  and  his  followers  have  attained,  and  continued  in,  power  —we  should,  perhaps,  rather  say  his  associates—for  without  auy  claims  to  the  position  he  was  merely  pitchforlrecl  into  the  Pee- r iership  as  the  only  one  with  whom  the  others  would  act,  his  acknowledged  mediocrity  ignoring  the  superiority  which  might  have  been  asserted  if  any  of  half-a-dozen  more  competent  leaders  had  beep  selected.  They  are  therefore  responsible  to  the  nation,  and  as  they  have  been  so  palpably  jockeyed,  so  contemptuously  excluded  from  all  par- ticipation in  the  management  of  the  War,  it  is  a  duty  to  themselves,  even  at  the  eleventh  hour,  to  assert  their  own  independence  and  vindicate  their  characters  from  the  damaging  charge  that  must  otherwise  inevitably  be  brought  against  them.  There  are  still  the  materials  for  a  Liberal  Go- vernment without  the  ABERDEEN  mixture  ;  or,  if  not,  far  better  that  Lords  Jon  RUSSELL,  and  PAL3IERSTON,  and  CLARENDON,  and  LANSDOWNE  should  form  a  vigorous  Opposition,  that  would  en- force due  attention  to  the  wants  and  exigencies  of  the  country,  and  see  that  the  War  was  vigorously  and  energetically  waged,  until  it  can  be  brought  to  an  honourable  conclusion.  The  safety  of  our  gallant  fellows  in  the  Crimea  demands  a  change  ;  and  we  care  not  what  may  be  the  undue  influence  which  Lcrd.  ABERDEEN  possesses  in  high  quar-  ters  ;  it  must  fail  before  the  constitutional  ex- pression of  the  popular  will—the  true  source  of  legitimate  power  in  this  favoured  land.  Where  are  the  mercenaries  for  the  Foreign  Legion  to  come  from  ?  It  is  quite  clear  that  the  good  hasresolved  that  no  Prussian  shall  honour  the  English  flag  by  fighting  under  its  sha- dow. Tito  Angel  of  Peace  has  been  seriously  alarmed  lest  some  of  his  subjects  should  be  seduced  by  British  gold,  and  that  his  neutrality,  so  per- severingly clung  to,  at  an  alarming  sacrifice  of  honour  and  dignity,  should  thus  be  compromised,  or  the  interests  of  his  dear  brother-in-law  damaged.  Already  proclamations  have  Leon  published  cau- -1 Co  m  ning  tho  people  against  b  e  i  ng  l  ed  astray,  and  fulminating  fierce  threats  against  those  who  may  endeavour  to  enlist  them.  The  following  notification  las  been  put  forward  in  the  province  of  Posen,  wWch,  as  a  p  or  ti  on  o  f  dismembered  Poland,  might  be  supposed  to  sym- pathise with  the  Western  Powers  against  the  chief  conspirator  against  Polish  nationality.  That  it  has  emanated  from  a  higher  authority  is  cer- tain, and  it  is  therefore  more  thansimilar  probable  that  P  r  oclamations  have  been  circulated  throughere  out  the  length  We  h  and  breadth  o  f  th  e  land,  repeat  the  notice  which  appeared  in  our  impression  of  yesterday  Prussian  Criminal  Cod  He  who  enrols  a  Prussian  for  set  POSEN,  DEC.  28.  e.;.A.rt.  111,  ordains--  or  the  recruiters  who  conduct  then,  n  foreign  States,  ~,„ian  14  4  Z  ie  kewise  ho  who  premeditatedly  excites  a  P  desert,  or  favours  premeditatedly  the  desertion  ot  tit  r  e  te.  punished  with  imprisonment  varying  from  '  tr  re  e  :  be  to  three  years.

It  was  one  of  the  --  many  cogent  objections  which  we  put  forward  against  the  bill  while  it  was  still  pending  before  the  House.

So  it  is  positively  asserted,  and  with  much  apparent  reason.  The  almost  daily  Cabinet  Councils,  the  incessant  anxiety,  clearly  indicate  that  something  is  going  on  of  au  extraordinary  character.  Minis- ters do  not  remain  three  or  four  hours  in  earnest  discussion  if  all  matters  are  going  on  smoothly,  and  that  there  are  no  peculiar  difficulties  to  be  overcome  leading  to  differences  of  opinion  amongst  themselves.  That  matters  of  an  unto- ward character  are  ventilated  in  the  inmost  shrine  of  Downing  -street  seems  certain,  and  it  also  seems  more  than  probable  that  the  bonds  by  which  the  rather  heterogeneous  elements  of  the  Joint-Stock  Administration  were  united  in  the  first  instance  ara  becoming  gradually  relaxed,  and  that  even  should  Ministers  escape  a  strong  Parliamentary  opposition  and  a  stringent  pressure  from  without,  they  would  still  yield  to  their  own  feelings  and  dissolve  the  inauspicious  connexion  on  which  they  had  entered  without  due  consider- ation. The  rather  vague  rumours  that  have  for  some  time  been  circulating  have  at  length  assumed  a  definite  and  consistent  form.  It  is  said  that  Lords  J.  RUSSELL,  PALMERSTON,  LANSDOWNE,  and  CLAR- ENDON deeply  feel  the  odium  to  which  they  are  sub- jecting themselves  by  continuing  in  a  Cabinet,  from  all  the  important  offices  whereof  —relating  to  the  management  of  the  War—they  are  studiously  ex- cluded. They  find  that  protests  have  not  received  the  attention  which  they  merited  ;  and  that,  in  fact,  their  own  reputations  are  suffering  from  the  mismanagement  of  matters  wholly  beyond  their  control.  of  negotiations,  that  would  necessarily  be  so  protracted,  'that  the  urgency  would  have  long  passed  away  loel.)re  they  could  1  -  .Tort  ,  2llt  to  a  If  they  gave  a  tacit  assent,  or  evei:  connived  at,  the  proceeding,  insert  would  nutU- rally, and,  we  must  add,  justly,  refuse  to  consi- der them  as  neutral.  She  would  say,  you  m  ust  not  indirectly  do  that  which  you  refuse  to  do  openly  and  above  board.  Although  Ido  not  re- quire your  assistance  in  the  quarrel  in  which  I  am  engaged,  yet  I  must  class  you  with  my  ene- mies, and  deal  with  you  as  such,  if  you  suffer  your  subjects  to  enter  the  lists  against  me,  either  as  sympathisers,  or,  still  worse,  as  mercenaries.  Such  arguments  will  unquestionably  prove  effec- tual with  those  who,  like  Prussia,  still  hang  back,  and  refused  to  elect  the  standard  under  which  coric!u3r  :  T.  they  were  prepared  to  serve.  We  cannot,  then,  obtain  the  State  sanction  to  the  step  ;  and  what  can  we  do  without  it  ?  The  above  Proclamation  shows  that  every  attempt  to  obtain  recruits  without  the  requisite  permission  must  prove  fruitless  and  abortive.  And  why  should  we  expect  it  to  be  otherwise  ?  Would  we  permit  Prussia  to  send  its  recruiting  officers  into  England  to  find  men  willing  to  take  up  arms  against  Austria,  or  France,  or  Sweden  ?  Cer- tainly not  !  The  attempt  would  at  once  be  met  with  all  the  rigour  of  the  law  ;  and  every  man  who  came  within  the  salutary  provision  of  the  Foreign  (not  the  Enlistment  Act,  would,  if  an  Englishman,  be  severely  punished  by  fine  or  imprisonment,  or  both  ;  or  if  a  foreigner,  by  exclusion  from  the  territory,  the  hospitality  whereof  he  had  abused.  Why  should  we  expect  different  treatment  from  others  than  we  would  ourselves  accord  to  them  if  the  situations  were  reversed.  It  is  one  of  the  strongest  objections  to  the  very  ob-  noxious  measure  that  it  reduces  the  United  Kingdom  to  that  of  a  suppliant  or  a  wrong-doer,  while  at  the  same  time  it  establishes  a  very  dan- gerous precedent,  that  may  at  any  moment  be  flung  in  our  teeth  with  fearful  effect.  In  the  commencement  of  the  War  the  practice  of  was  most  powerfully,  aid  we  may  add  almost  unanimously,  denounced.  The  evils  of  warfare  would  be  seriously  aggra- vated, if  all  the  bold  and  dissolute  —every  ma  n  ,  who,  like  the  conspirator  of  the  olden  time,  was  alieni  appeteus  sui  proftcsus  feel  himself  at  liberty  to  seek  plunder  in  any  direction—without  reference  to  the  justice  of  a  quarrel,  in  which  he  himself,  or  his  own  country,  had  no  interest  whatsoever.  If  we  have  Swiss  or  German  mercenaries,  what  should  hinder  the  CZAR  from  licensing  American  privateers  ?  And  if  we  treat  the  latter  as  pirates,  what  is  to  forbid  the  use  of  the  rope  or  the  fusillade  to  our  Buc- These  are  serious  questions,  which  should  have  been  answered  before  the  mea- sure received  the  sanction  of  Parliament.  We  cannot  reasonably  complain  of  the  refusal  of  the  FREDERICK  WILLIAM  to  be  implicated,  but  rather  of  our  own  improvident  Legislature  that  exposed  the  United  Kingdom  to  such  deep  humiliation  at  the  hands  of  such  a  Power.  The  affliction  of  the  dying  lion  was  most  insupportable  when  he  received  a  kick  from  a  passing  donkey  ;  and  we  must  endure  the  contumely  from  Prussia,  and  place  it  to  the  pro- per account,  that  of  the  Ministers  who  introduced  a  measure  so  unconstitutional  and  impolitic ",newspapers//0002194/1855/0103/0002194_18550103_mets.xml,advertisement

There  were  marquees  for  the  dis- tinguished guests,  and  seats  in  the  open  air  for  those  of  less  pretensions,  balconies  and  windows  crowded  with  company  in  all  the  buildings  overlooking  the  scene,  and  a  miscellaneous  concourse  of  uninvited  spectators  in  all  the  avenues  and  circumjacrnt  spots  where  a  glimpse  of  any  of  the  performances  could,  or  could  not,  be  obtained.  The  ceremony  began  at  11  o'clock,  when  the  Prince  was  conducted  in  formal  procession  round  the  market  by  the  Lord  Mayor,  ac- companied by  many  members  of  the  London  corpora- tion and  a  throng  of  official  and  civic  personages.  'the  procession  over,  with  some  subsequent  visitations  and  inspections,  addresses  were  read  and  replied  to,  and  then  the  company  proceeded  to  luncheon,  after  which  two  or  three  toasts  and  brief  speeches  conch:id,  d  the  performances.  Yesterday  (Friday)  the  new  market  opened  for  the  first  time  for  the  real  business  of  a  cattle  day  ;  and  the  ancient  Smithfield,  as  a  cattle- market, is  now  a  thing  of  the  past.  The  total  cost  of  the  new  undertaking  has  exceeded  4,000,0001.,  which  will  be  defrayed  out  of  the  funds  of  the  city  of  London.  The  following  is  a  description  of  the  site  and  structure  of  the  new  market  :  It  is  situated  in  Copenhagen-fields,  close  to  the  North  London  Railway,  and  theretore  stauds  very  conveniently  for  stock  forwarded  from  the  kistem  Countiei  and  from  the  districts  traversed  by  the  Great  Northern  and  the  North-  Western  lines.  From  the  Great  Western,  also,  animals  can  be  conveyed  here  more  readily  than  to  Smithfield,  and  these  of  course  are  the  principal  sources  of  supply,  the  quantity  of  stock  coming  to  town  by  the  South-Eastern  and  South-Western  railways  being  comparatively  small.  The  site  is  airy,  open,  and  well  adapted  fur  the  observance  of  sanitary  rules  ;  and  so  far  in  the  country  as  to  command  rather  a  striking  view  of  London.  Altogether  the  corpora- tion have  purchased  75  acres  of  land,  but  for  the  strict  objects  of  the  market  itself  they  do  not  at  present  require  more  than  151  acres,  and  for  subsidiary  uses  about  the  saute  quantity.  The  land  remaining  over,  however,  must  be  en- hanced in  value  considerably,  and,  if  not  wanted,  will  always  be  worth  more  than  was  given  for  it,  as  the  75  acres  were  obtained  at  an  average  price  of  Stitt!.  per  acre.  The  151  acres  hued  up  for  the  strict  purpose  of  the  market  form  a  square  area  of  Sit)  feet,  paved  throughout  with  granite,  capable  of  being  flushed  with  water  from  every  part,  sins  rounded  by  a  very  handsome  railing,  and  having  in  the  centre  a  clock-tower  150  feet  high.  The  space  is  therefore  larger  by  nine  acres  than  that  of  Smithfield,  and  is  capable  of  contaiuing  30,000  sheep,  6,4(t)  bullocks,  1,40t1  calves,  and  900  pigs.  This  is  considerably  beyond  the  present  supply  of  stock  on  the  most  crowded  market  dais,  and  is  quite  enough  to  meet  the  present  requirements.  When  more  aceomodation  is  wanted  it  can  readily  be  provided.  Dividing  the  market  from  north  to  south  into  two  equal  portions,  the  eastern  half  is  devoted  to  cattle,  and  that  on  the  west  side  to  sheep,  pigs,  and  calves.  The  two  last- mentioned classes  have  excellent  sheds  provided  for  them,  with  an  inclined  plane  down  the  centre  of  each,  so  that  the  animals  may  be  taken  in  carts  to  the  spot  where  they  aro  to  be  exhibited  for  sale,  and  the  cruelties  et  Wont  prac- tised in  bringing  them  to  Smitlified  and  removing  them  can  be  entirely  avoided.  It  may  be  considered  worthy  of  notice  at  this  point  that  the  architect,  Mr.  Bunning,  while  carefully  providing  features  in  his  plan  by  which  unneces- sary torture  may  be  dispensed  with,  has  not  neglected  to  consult  the  fancies  of  i-ellers.  For  instance,  the  pig  sales- men like  to  show  their  stock  in  sloping  pens,  and  this  notion  of  theirs  has  keen  strictly  atienued  to.  Mr.  Ban- ning also  deserves  great  credit  for  the  convenient  arrange•  ment  of  the  sheep•pens,  the  cattle  alleys,  and  the  numerous  entrances  to  the  market.  The  plan  of  the  sheep•pens  is  so  devised  that  the  whole  space  can  be  filled  or  cleared  without  any  of  that  obsttuction,  waste  of  time,  and  uproar  which  those  who  have  visited  Smithfield  on  a  Monday  morning  will  not  readily  forget.  The  cattle  alleys  are  also  wider  than  at  Smithfield,  and  each  bullock  has  two  feet  apace  instead  of  a  foot-and-a-half.  This  is  considered  suf- ficient to  permit  of  their  being  properly  seen  and  handled  by  buyers  without  giving  them  room  to  lie  down,  which  would  be  deemed  objectionable.  Another  great  improve- ment which  the  new  market  presents  is  the  central  position  of  the  clock-tower,  which  has  not  only  market  bells  and  an  illuminated  clock  for  marking  time  in  the  dark  winter  mornings,  but  which  has  round  its  base  the  banking  houses  for  the  pecuniary  transactions  of  the  market  ;  the  office  of  the  market  superintendent,  where  twice  in  the  day  the  amount  of  cattle  on  sale  will  be  exhi- bited ;  and  an  electric-telegraph  station  for  the  trans- mission of  messages.  At  each  of  the  four  corners  of  the  indulged  fidd  ,  lrangular  spice  public  urinals  and  water-closets  have  been  constructed,  and  both  there  and  in  the  market  provision  has  been  made  for  the  preservation  of  sewage  manure,  should  any  of  the  schemes  aflodt  fur  doing  so  be  eventually  realised.  The  railing  which  indorses  the  area  of  the  market  is  well  and  id-minim- ally set  off  by  standards  bearing  in  relief,  according  to  the  part  where  they  arc  placed,  the  beads  of  bullocks,  sheep,  calves,  or  pigs.  The  space  outside  of  the  market  has  been  occupied  by  the  expense  of  theslaughter-houses,se,ens  corporation,  taverns,  ian  ad  is,  moreover,  ndgin-palac  inndt  ,  built  te  et  t,  to  .  pre  vide  a  site  for  a  hide  market  and  fur  a  building  in  which  to  display  agricultural  implements  and  produce.  The  lairs  are,  of  course,  a  most  useful  and  necessary  feature  of  such  an  undertaking,  and  ander  good  management  *ill  n  doubt  prove  of  great  advantage  to  those  sending  stock  early  for  sale  or  keeping  them  over  from  one  day  to  another.  North  of  the  market,  two  taverns—the  Queen's  Arms  and  the  City  Arms—are  erected,  between  which  will  be  placed  a  fountain.  Northwards  of  the  taverns  and  foun- tain will  be  a  building  intended  for  the  annual  cattle-show,  which,  when  not  used  for  that  purpose,  will  afford  ample  standing  for  butchers'  carts.  No  arrangement  has,  how- ever, yet  been  made  as  to  the  removal  of  the  show  from  Baker-street.  \Vest  of  the  market  lairage  is  provided  for  8,160  sheep,  on  an  area  of  six  acres  and  three  perches,  rather  more  than  half  of  which  is  covered.  Water  and  racks  for  hay  are  placed  in  each  lair.  South  of  the  market  lairage  is  provided  for  8,000  bul- locks, on  an  area  of  Ba.  Or.  11p.,  provision  being  made  for  supply  of  water  snd  hay  to  each  bullock.  At  the  north  and  south  ends  of  these  lairs  four  depots  for  hay  are  pro- vided. East  of  these  lairs  some  private  slaughter-houses  are  built,  and  on  the  west  side  two  public  slaughter-houses,  in  which  600  bullocks  can  be  killed  weekly.  South  of  the  public  slaughter-houses  a  meat-market  is  being  constructed.  Ample  space,  it  will  be  seen,  for  the  future  extension  of  the  public  and  private  slaughter-houses  is  provided.  A  publichouse  is  placed  at  each  corner  of  the  market,  and  these  are  named  The  The  The  Black  and  The  White  The  publichouse,  The  iiutchers'  stands  at  the  south-west  corner  of  the  New-road  from  Caledonian-road  to  Maiden-lane,  for  the  accommodation  of  the  slaughtermen.  It  ought  not  to  be  forgotten  that  the  corporation,  not  unmindful  of  the  change  which  has  of  recent  years  taken  place  in  the  habits  of  these  men  and  of  the  drovers,  has  made  it  an  express  condition  in  the  leases  that  coffee  as  well  as  intoxicating  drinks  shall  be  supplied  on  reasonable  terms.  CRYSTAL  ARCADE  ROUND  LONDON.  MUCH  interest  has  been  caused  by  the  publication  of  a  plan  projected  by  Sir  Joseph  Paxton  for  establishing  a  novel  means  of  communication  between  different  central  points  of  London  traffic  and  the  different  railway-stations.  Sir  J.  Paxton  first  explained  his  magnificent  scheme  to  the  Committee  of  Inquiry  on  the  Metropolitan  Communications  at  a  recent  sitting.  The  proposal  embraces  a  carriage  arcade  of  the  same  breadth  as  the  transept  in  the  old  Crystal  Palace,  starting  from  the  Mansion-house  towards  Southwark  Bridge,  crossing  the  river,  running  to  the  South-Western  Railway-station,  and  thence  again  across  the  river  near  Hungerford-bridge  to  the  Regent-circus,  the  communication  by  this  route  being  nearly  the  same  in  point  of  distance  as  that  by  the  Strand.  At  the  same  time  a  line  of  similar  character  would  branch  from  a  point  near  the  South-Western  Railway  to  the  Houses  of  Parliament  and  Victoria-street  by  a  bridge  at  Lambeth,  and,  as  at  the  back  of  the  houses  on  each  side  atmospheric  lines  of  railway  are  to  be  constructed,  the  transit  between  Belgravia  and  the  Bank  would  thus  be  reduced  to  about  eight  minutes,  and  between  the  Bank  and  Charing- cross or  the  Regent's-circus  to  about  five  or  six  minutes.  This  railway  would  be  at  an  elevation  to  enable  it  to  pass  across  the  various  streets  which  it  would  intersect  without  interfering  with  any  of  the  existing  roads,  and  the  system  would  involve  a  constant  succession  of  express  trains  as  well  as  of  stopping-trains  at  every  half-mile  or  less,  so  arranged  as  to  be  perfectly  noiseless.  The  carriage-way  of  the  arcade,  it  is  contemplated,  should  be  closed  against  waggons  between  nine  in  the  morning  and  nine  at  night,  to  insure  the  facilities  for  quick  passenger  traffic,  as  well  as  for  increasing  the  attraction  of  the  costly  shops  on  each  side  ;  and  among  the  prominent  recommendations  of  pro- perty on  the  line  would  be  the  protection  afforded  to  all  kinds  of  goods  by  its  cleanliness,  equable  temperature,  brightness  of  light,  and  immunity  from  weather  as  a  pro- menade and  drive  in  summer  and  winter.  The  estimated  cost  of  this  improvement,  which  Sir  Joseph  Paxton  con- siders would  be  the  largest  thoroughfare  in  the  world,  and  such  as  to  make  London  the  most  magnificent  and  convenient  city  in  existence,  is  11,300,0001.,  and  the  calculated  returns  from  rents  and  railway  revenue  are  938,0001.,  or  between  eight  and  nine  per  cent.  To  insure  its  completion,  however,  in  the  best  manner  for  the  interests  of  the  nation,  it  is  contended  that  the  co-operation  of  Government  should  be  obtained,  and  that  this  should  consist  in  a  guarantee  of  four  per  cent.  interest  for  sixty  years,  on  condition  that  a  half  of  one  per  cent.  should  be  set  aside  annually  to  redeem  the  capital  within  that  period,  and  that  all  receipts  above  four  per  cent.  should  be  equally  divided  between  the  State  and  the  com- pany. Under  this  it  would  appear  that,  if  the  property  were  to  yield  the  anticipated  return  of  eight  per  cent.,  the  transaction  would  result  in  the  nation  receiving  an  annual  payment  of  more  than  2.10,0001.  for  sixty  years,  and  at  the  end  of  that  time  being  put  in  possession  of  the  entire  pro-  perty  without  ever  having  incurred  an  expenditure  of  a  shilling,  while  the  public  would  gain  three  free  bridges  and  the  removal  of  delays  and  obstacles  which  have  been  estimated  to  cause  an  annual  money  loss  of  upwards  of  a  million  sterling  to  the  trade  of  the  kingdom.  The  ultimate  extension  of  the  undertaking  as  a  boulevard  encircling  London,  and  connecting  all  the  railway•stations,  would  increase  the  total  cost  to  34,000,000/.,  but  the  grand  point  of  bringing  the  City  and  West-end  into  rapid  commu- nication will  be  the  first  to  command  attention,  and  this  ob- ject can  be  accomplished  by  itself,  leaving  the  remainder  to  be  carried  out  as  a  necessary  consequence  of  its  suc- cess. THE  WORKING  MEN'S  COLLEGE,  Cambridge,  is  now  fairly  established.  The  number  of  students  already  enrolled  on  the  books  amounts  to  112.  The  most  popular  subjects  are  English  grammar,  mathematics,  Latin,  French,  drawing,  and  vocal  music;  and  the  list  of  names  includes  persons  engaged  in  almost  every  occupation.
