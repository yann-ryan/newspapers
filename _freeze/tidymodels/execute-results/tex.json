We'll build a classifier which learns, from some pre-labelled examples, to differentiate between advertisements and news articles. We'll evaluate the model, and fine-tune its parameters. This chapter is heavily indebted to existing tidymodels tutorials on the web, such as the one from [Supervised Machine Learning in R](https://smltar.com/mlclassification.html) by Emil Hvitfeldt and Julia Silge.\n\n## Machine Learning\n\nMachine learning is the name for a group of techniques which take input data of some kind, and learn how to achieve some particular goal. The 'deep learning' used by neural networks and in particular things like ChatGPT are one type, but the field has been around for much longer than that.\n\nMachine learning itself can be divided into subsets: Machine learning done with neural networks, and what we might call 'classical' machine learning, which use algorithms.\n\nA very simple form of machine learning is *linear regression*. Linear regression attempts to find the best fitting line through a dataset. Take this dataset of the flipper size and body mass of a group of observed penguins (from the R package `palmerpenguins`:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tidymodels_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nBy visually inspecting this, we can guess that there is a statistical relationship between the length and mass: as one value gets higher, the other does too. We can use `geom_smooth()` and a linear model to predict the best line of fit through this dataset:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`).\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tidymodels_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIf we measured the slope of this line (using simple geometry), its angle would tell us about the relationship between the two values.In this way, our model helps us to understand some underlying pattern in the dataset - that these two values are highly correlated. We could also use it to *predict* new values: if given the body mass for a new penguin, by using this line, we could predict its most likely flipper length, and in most cases be fairly accurate.\n\nThis is a form of simple machine learning. We give an algorithm (here, linear regression) a bunch of input data, in this case the body mass and bill flipper length for a group of penguins, and it provides a model (in this case, a line with a certain slope), which hopefully helps us to explain the existing data and predict unknown parts. Models like this try in some way to minimise a loss function. In this case, finding the line where the error for each point (how far away it is from the line) is as small as possible.\n\nThe machine learning here will use basically the same principle. We'll give it data (text, in the form of a mathematical representation of the text, and its assigned category), and an algorithm (in this case, a 'Random Forest' model), and use that to predict the category of unseen texts. The model itself may also tell us something about the existing data.\n\nMuch of the AI work at the cutting edge of text analysis today uses neural networks, and in particular the 'transformer' mechanism which allows neural networks to better understand context and word order. But this kind of machine learning still has a very important role to play, it's well-established, relatively easy to run, and the results can be quite good depending on the problem. It is also a good way to get started with understanding the Tidymodels framework.\n\n## The Tidymodels Package\n\nTidymodels is an R 'meta-package' which allows you to interact with lots of different machine learning packages and engines in a consistent way. Using tidymodels, we can easily compare multiple models together and we can swap in one for another without having to re-do code. We also can make sure that our pre-processing steps are precisely consistent across any number of different models.\n\nMachine learning can be used for a number of different tasks. One key one is text classification.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will use tidymodels to classify text into articles and advertisements. It could easily be generalised to any number of categories, for example foreign news, court reporting, and so forth. You can provide your own spreadsheet of training data (as we'll use below), and as long as it is in the same format and has similar information, you should be able to build your own classifier.\n\nOnce we have built the model, we will fine-tune it. The random forest algorithm we'll use, like most machine learning algorithms, has a group of parameters which can be adjusted. To find the best values for these, we'll evaluate the same data using many different combinations of parameters, and pick the best one. Using tidymodels, this can all be done consistently. We could even swap out any other model type, and otherwise reuse the exact same workflow.\n\nFinally, we'll put the model to some use: we'll use the model to predict the class of the rest of the articles in the newspaper dataset, and do some analysis on this.\n\nThe model is only as good as the training data, and in this case, we don't have many examples, and it won't be terribly accurate in many cases. But it will show how a machine learning model can be operationalised for this task.\n\n### Basic Steps\n\nIn this chapter we'll create a model which can label newspaper as either articles or advertisements. We'll do some further steps to explore improving the model, and also to look at the most important 'features' used by the model to do its predicting. The steps are:\n\n1.  Download a labelled dataset, containing examples of our two classes (articles and advertisements).\n\n2.  Create a 'recipe' which is a series of pre-processing steps. This same recipe can be reused in different contexts and for different models.\n\n3.  Split the labelled data into testing and training sets. The training data is used to fit the best model. The test set is used at the end, to see how well it performs on unseen data.\n\n4.  Run an initial classifier and evaluate the results\n\n5.  'Tune' the model, by re--running the classifier with different parameters, selecting the best one.\n\n6.  Run the 'best' model over the full news dataset, predicting whether or not an articles is news or an advertisement.\n\n## Install/load the packages\n\nAs a first step, you'll need to load the necessary packages for this tutorial. If you haven't already done so, you can install them first using the below.\n\nIf you have installed them, make sure you update to the latest version, as they can change rapidly.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages('tidyverse')\ninstall.packages('tidymodels')\ninstall.packages('textrecipes')\ninstall.packages('tidytext')\ninstall.packages('ranger')\ninstall.packages('vip')\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(textrecipes)\nlibrary(tidytext)\nlibrary(ranger)\nlibrary(vip)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Import data\n\nAs a first step, load some pre-labelled data. This contains a number of newspaper articles, and their 'type': whether it is an advertisement or an article.\n\nIf we take a look at the dataframe once it is loaded, you'll see it's quite simple structure: it's got a 'filename' column, the full text of the article store in 'text', and the type stored in a column called 'type'.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadvertisements_labelled = read_csv('advertisements_labelled.csv')\n\nadvertisements_labelled = advertisements_labelled %>% filter(!is.na(text))\n\nadvertisements_labelled %>% head(5) %>% kableExtra::kbl()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{tabular}[t]{l|r|l|l|l}\n\\hline\nfilename & art & text & issue\\_name & type\\\\\n\\hline\nnewspapers//0002194/1855/0328/0002194\\_18550328.csv & 107 & 4  ,;,-A4J  -  BriTtr  EMIT  MO  NT  BLANC  aci  t  s  WILT,  at  8  o'clock,  apd  Every  111,,  ,  1it  .

The  fall  of  Kars  has  had,  at  any  rate,  this  good  result,—that  it  has  at  last  drawn  public  attention  to  the  theatre  of  those  operations  to  which  it  has  succumbed,  and  taught  us  the  importance  attached  by  a  vigilant  and  skilful  enemy,  thoroughly  ac- quainted both  with  the  ground  and  the  people,  to  a  remote  position,  with  which  the  British  public  has  scarcely  cared  to  make  itself  acquainted.  No- body can  doubt  the  vast  importance  attached  by  the  Czar  to  the  preservation  of  Sebastopol  and  of  the  fleet  which  sleeps  beneath  the  waters  of  its  har- bour. The  unceasing  exertions  and  dreadful  sacri- fices of  Russia  attest  it  only  too  well.  To  save  the  place  was  the  point  of  honour  of  the  empire—the  one  object,  compared  with  which  all  others  seemed  puny  and  insignificant.  Yet,  even  in  this  crisis  of  his  destiny,  the  Emperor  of  Russia  could  despatzli  probably  his  best  General  and  an  army  whose  bravery  is  only  too  well  attested  by  its  enormous  and  almost  incredible  losses  on  the  29th  of  Septem- ber, not  to  defend  his  own  frontier,  but  make  a  hostile  inroad  into  the  Turkish  territory,  and  to  possess  himself  of  a  city  situated  in  a  mountainous  region  and  exposed  to  an  inclement  climate.  So  eager  was  Mouravieff  for  the  prize,  and  so  deter- mined to  win  at  all  costs,  that  se  soon  as  lie  heard  of  the  fall  of  Sebastopol,  attributing  to  the  allied  Generals  a  degree  of  foresight  and  activity  which  they  were  very  far  indeed  from  possessing,  ho  deemed  it  necessary  to  anticipate,  at  whatever  cost,  the  expedition  they  wore  sure  to  make,  and  so  sustained  a  repulse  which  cost  him  a  third  of  his  army.  Had  ho  known  the  easy  and  comfortable  tactics  of  the  allies  ho  might  have  saved  his  even,  and  taken  the  city  just  as  well  ;  but  it  would  be  ungracious  to  blame  an  enemy  for  thinking  bettor  of  us  than  we  deserve.  What  now  presses  for  consideration  is  whether  we  are  tamely  to  sit  down  with  this  loss  ;  whether  that  which  the  Russian  General  has  gained  through  our  negligence  he  is  to  be  allowed  to  keep  through  our  supineness  and  want  of  enterprise.  If  we  are  ■ot  to  have  peace  we  must  seek  out  some  vulner- able point  in  which  we  may  strike  Russia  between  the  joints  of  her  armour,—some  place  in  which  a  victory  may  give  us  something  more  than  a  barren  triumph,  and  draw  after  it  other  results  than  inter- minable catalogues  of  killed  and  wounded.  While  Sebastopol  was  untaken  we  considered  it  so  indis- putably the  first  object  of  the  war  that  we  were  well  satisfied  to  sacrifice  everything  else  to  its  at- tainment. The  struggle  was  so  gigantic,  our  in- terests and  our  honour  were  so  obviously  at  stake,  that  no  success,  however  great,  could  compensate  us  for  any  delay  or  any  failure  there.  But,  Sebas- topol once  taken,  a  campaign  in  the  Crimea  has  no  other  object  than  the  capture  or  destruction  of  the  Russian  troops  encamped  within  the  penin- sula. The  Crimea  itself,  except  as  a  battle-ground,  is  utterly  worthless,  and  we  are  only  justified  in  remaining  there  on  the  supposition  that  there  we  can  inflict  more  serious  wounds  on  Russia  than  elsewhere.  Whether  this  be  so  or  not  we  cannot  judge.  Unless  the  coming  campaign  is  to  open  with  a  spirit  and  a  brilliancy  very  different  from  the  close  of  its  predecessor,  200,000  men  could  not  be  more  entirely  thrown  away  than  in  occupying  the  plateau  between  Kamiesh  and  Balaklava.  Of  this,  at  any  rate,  we  may  feel  confident—that  an  expeditionary  army  can  well  be  spared  to-coperate  with  Omer  Pasha  in  the  Transcaucasian  provinces,  and  to  redeem  the  fallen  honour  of  the  allies  in  the  estimation  of  the  semi-civilised  Courts  of  Asia.  We  are  making  war  as  mach  against  Russian  pres- tige as  Russian  power,  and  cannot  afford  to  allow  her,  by  easy  Asiatic  successes,  to  obliterate  the  effect  of  European  defeats  inflicted  upon  her  at  so  tremendous  a  cost.  We  know  not  what  other  field  is  left  for  our  enterprise.  To  march  into  the  deso- late interior  would  bo  to  follow  the  steps  of  Charles  XII.  and  Sweden  to  certain  destruction.  The  capture  of  Nicolaieff  may  hardly  repay  its  cost  while  we  hold  the  narrow  passage  through  which  alone  the  ships  built  at  its  dockyards  can  find  their  way  into  the  sea  ;  but  in  the  rich  and  beau- tiful valley  that  lies  between  the  opposing  ranges  of  the  Caucasus  and  Ararat,  with  its  glittering  streams,  its  emerald  meadows,  its  waving  beech  woods,  its  snow-capped  mountains,  we  have  a  land  peculiarly  adapted  for  the  operations  of  an  Euro- pean force.  In  the  north  towards  the  Kouban  are  Mussulman  tribes  who,  it  is  supposed,  would  fly  to  arms  if  a  Turkish  division  were  sent  among  them,  and  the  banks  of  the  Phasis  and  the  Cyrus  are  inhabited  by  races  ivh  o  would  gladly  welcome  and  heartily  sup- port a  Christian  deliverer.  To  cut  off  the  garrison  ,  of  Kars  from  all  communication  with  Russia,  to  close  the  passes  of  the  Caucasus,  to  scale  the  ascent  which  leads  to  the  tableland  of  Georgia,  to  drive  the  Russians  before  us  through  Teflis  to  the  very  shores  of  the  Caspian  Sea,  are  enterprises  the  re- sults of  which  would  be  enormous,  but  the  difficulty  of  which  would  bs  by  no  means  so  great  as  those  over  which  we  have  already  triumphed.  Resting  on  our  fleet  and  a  friendly  population  as  a  secure  basis  of  operations,  it  would  be  easy  for  the  allies  to  wrest  from  the  hands  of  the  Russians  the  com- mand of  the  Caspian  Sea,  and  to  restore  to  Persia  that  of  which  Russia  has  deprived  her—the  right  of  navigating  what  must  in  all  fairness  be  considered  her  waters.  Either  we  must  be  prepared  to  enter  on  some  such  enterprise  as  this,  or  to  leave  the  Emperor  in  possession  of  his  present  conquests,  and  in  a  condition  to  push  them  further  so  soon  as  he  shall  be  relieved  from  the  vast  concentration  of  his  forces  which  the  contest  for  the  possession  of  Sebas- topol had  rendered  necessary.  The  affairs  of  Asia  cannot  be  left  as  they  are  ;  there,  and  there  alone,  Russia  is  still  able  to  assume  the  offensive,  and  will  infallibly  attain  more,  unless  we  take  away  from  her  that  which  she  now  has.  Lot  it  not  be  supposed  that  in  suggesting  a  cam- paign in  the  Transcaucasian  provinces  we  are  ,  actuated  by  any  desire  meanly  and  selfishly  to  employ  the  power  of  France  to  carry  out  merely  English  objects  ;  we  repeat  what  we  have  so  often  said—that  we  have  no  fear  whatever  from  Russia  for  our  Indian  empire.  Nothing  that  she  has  done  in  this  war  raises  our  opinion  of  her  as  an  aggressive  Power,  and  in  India  she  would  be  en- countered by  a  combination  of  obstacles  far  more  formidable  than  any  which  she  has  hitherto  been  called  upon  to  surmount.  We  have  no  wish  to  in- volve ourselves  in  the  maze  of  Central  Asian  in- trigues. We  have  no  wish  for  any  increase  of  territory  to  the  north  of  the  Himalayas.  All  our  objects  would  be  strictly  common  to  us  with  our  ally.  We  wish  to  strike  Russia  in  the  most  vul- nerable point.  We  wish  to  oppose  to  her  future  aggression  the  rugged  barrier  of  the  Caucasus  and  the  still  more  rugged  valour  of  its  tribes.  We  wish  to  prevent  her  from  practising  upon  Persia  those  arts  and  those  menaces  which  so  nearly  suc- ceeded against  Turkey.  We  are  no  more  disposed  to  tolerate  her  presence  at  Teheran  than  at  Con•  stantinople  or  Hammerfest.  We  would  not  allow  Russia  to  turn  the  left  flank  of  Turkey  by  the  Balkan—we  must  not  permit  her  to  turn  the  right,  which  now  lies  open  to  her  by  way  of  the  valleys  of  the  Tigris  and  the  Euphrates.  We  have  stopped  her  external  commerce  ;  it  is  time  wo  applie  d  a  tourniquet  to  he  r  main  artery,—the  vast  flood  of  the  Volga.  Th  ese  thi  ngs  mus  t  be  done,  not  in  the  interest  of  England  alone,  but  in  that  of  the  world.  A  solid  peace  can  only  be  founded  on  the  conviction  of  the  power  of  the  Allies,  and  that  conviction  will  then  be  most  surely  pro  d  uc  ed  when  we  employ  our  strength  at  those  points,  not  where  our  enesty  is  most,  but  where  he  is  least,  prepared  to  receive  us.  The  Pkare  de  la  Manche  announces  that  30,000  or  40,000  men  will  probably  be  encamped  this  winter  i❑  the  neighbourhood  of  Cherbourg  for  the  purpose  of  being  embarked  next  spring  for  the  Russian  Baltic  pro- vinces. The  establishment  of  another  camp  of  20,000  men,  near  Brest,  is  \\&amp;aa  talked  of. & newspapers//0002194/1855/1228/0002194\\_18551228\\_mets.xml & advertisement\\\\\n\\hline\nnewspapers//0002194/1855/0529/0002194\\_18550529.csv & 67 & WOODIN'S  ENTERTAINMENT.

We set a seed for reproducibility to ensure consistent results when randomization is involved. The target variable 'type' in the advertisements data is converted to a factor as it represents categorical classes ('advertisement' and 'article').\n\nThe data is then split into training and testing sets using the `initial_split` function. This separation is crucial for evaluating the performance of the machine learning model and preventing overfitting.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(9999)\nadvertisements_labelled = advertisements_labelled %>% \n  mutate(type = factor(type))\n\nadvertisements_split <- initial_split(advertisements_labelled, strata = type)\n\nadvertisements_train <- training(advertisements_split)\nadvertisements_test <- testing(advertisements_split)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Create Recipe for Text Data\n\nTo prepare the text data for modeling, we create a recipe using the `recipe` function. The `textrecipes` package provides essential tools for text preprocessing and feature extraction in machine learning. In this recipe, we tokenize the text, remove stop words, and apply a term frequency transformation to represent the text data as numerical features. These transformations convert the raw text data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms, enabling them to process and understand textual information.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadvertisement_rec <-\n  recipe(type ~ text, data = advertisements_train)\n\nadvertisement_rec <- advertisement_rec %>%\n  step_tokenize(text, token = \"words\") %>%\n  step_tokenfilter(text, max_tokens = 1000, min_times = 5 )  %>% \n  step_tf(text)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNext, we set up a `workflow()` object, which will store the recipe and later the model instructions, and make it easier to reuse.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadvertisement_wf <- workflow() %>%\n  add_recipe(advertisement_rec)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nCreate the model. In this case, we'll use a random forest model, from the package `ranger`. Setting the `importance = \"impurity\"` parameter means we'll be able to see what words the model used to make its decisions.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrf_spec <- rand_forest(\"classification\") %>%\n  set_engine(\"ranger\", importance = \"impurity\")\n\nrf_spec\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRandom Forest Model Specification (classification)\n\nEngine-Specific Arguments:\n  importance = impurity\n\nComputational engine: ranger \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nTake the workflow object we made above, and add the model to it. After this, use `fit` to run the model, specifying it should use the `advertisements_train` dataset we created above.\n\nFinally, we use `predict` on this fitted model, specifying `advertisements_test` as the dataset. Add the true labels from `advertisements_test` as a new column, and use `accuracy()` to compare the true label with the prediction to get an accuracy score.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n advertisement_wf %>%\n  add_model(rf_spec) %>%\n  fit(data = advertisements_train)%>%\n  predict(new_data = advertisements_test) %>%\n  mutate(truth = advertisements_test$type) %>%\n  accuracy(truth, .pred_class)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 x 3\n  .metric  .estimator .estimate\n  <chr>    <chr>          <dbl>\n1 accuracy binary         0.811\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Perform Cross-Validation\n\nTo evaluate the model further, we'll use cross-validation. Cross-validation is a crucial step in model evaluation. It helps assess the model's generalization performance on unseen data and reduces the risk of overfitting.\n\nIn this step, we set up cross-validation folds using the `vfold_cv` function, which creates multiple training and testing sets from the training data. The model will be trained and evaluated on each fold separately, providing a more robust estimate of its performance.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(234)\nadvertisements_folds <- vfold_cv(advertisements_train)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Train the Random Forest Model with Cross-Validation\n\nNow, we train the Random Forest model using cross-validation. The `fit_resamples` function fits the model to each fold created during cross-validation, allowing us to evaluate its performance across different subsets of the training data. The `control_resamples` function is used to control various settings during the resampling process.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrf_wf <- workflow() %>%\n  add_recipe(advertisement_rec) %>%\n  add_model(rf_spec)\n\nrf_wf\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n== Workflow ====================================================================\nPreprocessor: Recipe\nModel: rand_forest()\n\n-- Preprocessor ----------------------------------------------------------------\n3 Recipe Steps\n\n* step_tokenize()\n* step_tokenfilter()\n* step_tf()\n\n-- Model -----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRandom Forest Model Specification (classification)\n\nEngine-Specific Arguments:\n  importance = impurity\n\nComputational engine: ranger \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrf_rs <- fit_resamples(\n  rf_wf,\n  advertisements_folds,\n  control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Evaluate the Model's Performance\n\nIn this step, we collect the evaluation metrics and predictions from the cross-validation process. The collected metrics will help us assess the model's performance, while the predictions on each fold will be used for further analysis and comparison. By evaluating the model on multiple subsets of the data, we can gain insights into its robustness and reliability.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrf_rs_metrics <- collect_metrics(rf_rs)\nrf_rs_predictions <- collect_predictions(rf_rs)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Visualize the Confusion Matrix\n\nThe confusion matrix is a useful visualization for evaluating the performance of a classification model. It shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. The `autoplot` function from the `yardstick` package allows us to visualize the confusion matrix as a heatmap. This visualization aids in understanding the model's classification accuracy and any potential misclassifications.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nconf_mat_resampled(rf_rs, tidy = FALSE) %>%\n  autoplot(type = \"heatmap\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tidymodels_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-15-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe can see that there are very few true advertisements which are misclassified as articles - but there are some some articles misclassified as advertisements.\n\n## Tune the Random Forest Model\n\nIn machine learning, hyperparameter tuning is essential for optimizing model performance. In this step, we define a tuning grid using the `rand_forest` function. The grid specifies different combinations of hyperparameters, such as the number of variables randomly sampled for splitting (`mtry`) and the minimum number of samples per leaf node (`min_n`). We aim to find the best combination of hyperparameters that yields the highest performance.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntune_spec <- rand_forest(\n  mtry = tune(),\n  trees = 1000,\n  min_n = tune()\n) %>%\n  set_mode(\"classification\") %>%\n  set_engine(\"ranger\", importance = \"impurity\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntune_wf <- workflow() %>%\n  add_recipe(advertisement_rec) %>%\n  add_model(tune_spec)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Tune the Random Forest Model with Cross-Validation\n\nNow, we perform hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation. The `tune_grid` function uses the tuning grid specified earlier and fits the model on each fold of the data to identify the optimal hyperparameters. This process helps us identify the best hyperparameters for the Random Forest model, leading to improved performance and better generalization.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(555)\ntrees_folds = vfold_cv(advertisements_train)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndoParallel::registerDoParallel()\n\nset.seed(666)\ntune_res = tune_grid(\n  tune_wf,\n  resamples = trees_folds,\n  grid = 20\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\ni Creating pre-processing data to finalize unknown parameter: mtry\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntune_res\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# Tuning results\n# 10-fold cross-validation \n# A tibble: 10 x 4\n   splits          id     .metrics          .notes          \n   <list>          <chr>  <list>            <list>          \n 1 <split [95/11]> Fold01 <tibble [40 x 6]> <tibble [0 x 3]>\n 2 <split [95/11]> Fold02 <tibble [40 x 6]> <tibble [0 x 3]>\n 3 <split [95/11]> Fold03 <tibble [40 x 6]> <tibble [0 x 3]>\n 4 <split [95/11]> Fold04 <tibble [40 x 6]> <tibble [0 x 3]>\n 5 <split [95/11]> Fold05 <tibble [40 x 6]> <tibble [0 x 3]>\n 6 <split [95/11]> Fold06 <tibble [40 x 6]> <tibble [0 x 3]>\n 7 <split [96/10]> Fold07 <tibble [40 x 6]> <tibble [0 x 3]>\n 8 <split [96/10]> Fold08 <tibble [40 x 6]> <tibble [0 x 3]>\n 9 <split [96/10]> Fold09 <tibble [40 x 6]> <tibble [0 x 3]>\n10 <split [96/10]> Fold10 <tibble [40 x 6]> <tibble [0 x 3]>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Visualize the Tuning Results\n\nTo visualize the tuning results, we plot the average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC) against different values of `mtry` and `min_n`. ROC AUC is a common metric for assessing the model's ability to discriminate between classes. The plot provides insights into how different hyperparameter values affect the model's performance.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntune_res %>%\n  collect_metrics() %>%\n  filter(.metric == \"roc_auc\") %>%\n  select(mean, min_n, mtry) %>%\n  pivot_longer(min_n:mtry,\n    values_to = \"value\",\n    names_to = \"parameter\"\n  ) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(value, mean, color = parameter)) +\n  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~parameter, scales = \"free_x\") +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = \"AUC\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tidymodels_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-20-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIt's a little difficult to interpret, but it looks like the highest values are between about 40 and 250 for the `mtry` value, and around 10 and 30 for the `min_n` value. We can do another grid search, this time just looking between these values.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrf_grid <- grid_regular(\n  mtry(range = c(40, 250)),\n  min_n(range = c(10,30)),\n  levels = 5\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(999)\nregular_res <- tune_grid(\n  tune_wf,\n  resamples = trees_folds,\n  grid = rf_grid\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nregular_res %>%\n  collect_metrics() %>%\n  filter(.metric == \"roc_auc\") %>%\n  mutate(min_n = factor(min_n)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(mtry, mean, color = min_n)) +\n  geom_line(alpha = 0.5, size = 1.5) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(y = \"AUC\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\ni Please use `linewidth` instead.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tidymodels_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-23-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbest_auc <- select_best(regular_res, \"roc_auc\")\n\nfinal_rf <- finalize_model(\n  tune_spec,\n  best_auc\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nLastly, evaluate the accuracy using the same method as before:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadvertisement_wf %>%\n  add_model(final_rf) %>%\n  fit(data = advertisements_train)%>%\n  predict(new_data = advertisements_test) %>%\n  mutate(truth = advertisements_test$type) %>%\n  accuracy(truth, .pred_class)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 x 3\n  .metric  .estimator .estimate\n  <chr>    <chr>          <dbl>\n1 accuracy binary         0.865\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAs you can see, we have improved the model's performance, from about .80 to about .86. There are other ways you could try to improve the performance further. With text, the pre-processing steps can often make a huge difference. You could experiment with the text 'recipe', for instance adjusting `step_tokenfilter` to include or remove more tokens. You could also use `step_word_embeddings`, using the output of the word embeddings in [Chapter -@sec-word2vec].\n\n## Build the Final Random Forest Model\n\nIn this step, we build the final Random Forest model using the best hyperparameters obtained from tuning. The model is then fitted on the entire training dataset to capture the relationships between features and target classes optimally. This final model is the one that we will use for making predictions on new data.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfinal_wf <- workflow() %>%\n  add_recipe(advertisement_rec) %>%\n  add_model(final_rf)\n\nfinal_res <- final_wf %>%\n  last_fit(advertisements_split)\n\nfinal_res %>%\n  collect_metrics()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 2 x 4\n  .metric  .estimator .estimate .config             \n  <chr>    <chr>          <dbl> <chr>               \n1 accuracy binary         0.865 Preprocessor1_Model1\n2 roc_auc  binary         0.888 Preprocessor1_Model1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## What features is the model using?\n\nTo understand how the model is using the text to make decisions, we can look at the most important features (in this case, text frequency counts) used by the random forest algorithm. We'll use the package `vip` to extract the most important features, using the function `extract_fit_parsnip()`, and plotting it using `ggplot2`.\n\nFor the random forest method, we can only see the overall top features, and not which were more important for the prediction of the different categories. The most important feature is the frequency of the word 'street': at a guess, this is used more often in advertisements, which very often contain an address to a business or service. Interestingly, the second most important feature is the word 'was'. Is this perhaps because news articles are more likely to use the past tense than advertisements? Interestingly, the frequency of certain function words such as `the`, `and`, `to`, `of` (which would often be filtered out as 'stop words') also seems to be important to the model. One explanation is that the use of these words is quite different in prose and in the kind of text used in advertisements.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncomplaints_imp <- extract_fit_parsnip(final_res$.workflow[[1]]) %>%\n  vi(lambda = choose_acc$penalty)\n\ncomplaints_imp %>% \n  mutate(Variable = str_remove(Variable, \"tfidf_text_\")) %>% \n  head(20) %>% \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_col(aes(x = reorder(Variable,Importance), y= Importance)) + coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tidymodels_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-27-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Using the Model\n\nOnce we are happy with the final model, we can use it to label unseen data as either articles or advertisements. For this, we'll need a newspaper corpus. As in previous chapters, either construct your own corpus by following [Chapter -@sec-download] and [Chapter -@sec-extract], or [download](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8262355) and open the ready-made .zip file with all issues from 1855. Next, get these articles into the correct format. See [Chapter -@sec-count] for an explanation of this code:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_sample_dataframe = list.files(path = \"newspaper_text/\", \n                                   pattern = \"csv\", \n                                   recursive = TRUE, \n                                   full.names = TRUE)\n\n\nall_files = lapply(news_sample_dataframe, data.table::fread) \n\nnames(all_files) = news_sample_dataframe\n\nall_files_df = data.table::rbindlist(all_files, idcol = 'filename')\n    \n\ntitle_names_df = tibble(newspaper_id = c('0002090', '0002194', '0002244', '0002642', '0002645', '0003089', '0002977'), newspaper_title = c('The Liverpool Standard And General Commercial Advertiser', 'The Sun', 'Colored News', 'The Express', 'The Press', 'Glasgow Courier', 'Swansea and Glamorgan Herald'))\n\nnews_df = all_files_df %>% \n  mutate(filename = basename(filename))\n\n\nnews_df = news_df %>% \n  separate(filename, \n           into = c('newspaper_id', 'date'), sep = \"_\") %>% # separate the filename into two columns\n  mutate(date = str_remove(date, \"\\\\.csv\")) %>% # remove .csv from the new data column\n  select(newspaper_id, date, art, text) %>% \n  mutate(date = ymd(date)) %>% # turn the date column into date format\n  mutate(article_code = 1:n()) %>% # give every article a unique code\n  select(article_code, everything()) %>% # select all columns but with the article code first \n  left_join(title_names_df, by = 'newspaper_id') # join the titles \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Make Predictions on Newspaper Articles\n\nWith the final Random Forest model trained, we proceed to make predictions on the newspaper articles' text data. This involves applying the text preprocessing steps (e.g., tokenization, TF-IDF) used during training to transform the new data into the same format. The model then predicts whether each article is an advertisement or not.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnew_ads_to_check = final_wf %>%\n  fit(data = advertisements_train)%>%\n  predict(new_data = news_df)\n\nall_files_df = all_files_df %>% \n  mutate(prediction =new_ads_to_check$.pred_class)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Analyze the Top Words in Advertisements\n\nAfter making predictions, we perform text analysis to identify the top words associated with advertisements. We tokenize the text data, count the occurrences of each word for each prediction, and select the most frequent words in advertisements. This analysis allows us to gain insights into the language patterns characteristic of advertisements.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata('stop_words')\n\n\nall_files_df %>% \n  head(10000) %>% \n  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% \n  filter(!str_detect(word, \"[0-9]\")) %>% \n  anti_join(stop_words) %>% \n  count(prediction, word) %>% \n  group_by(prediction) %>% \n  slice_max(order_by = n, n = 10) %>% ungroup() %>% \n    mutate(prediction = as.factor(prediction),\n           word = reorder_within(word, n, prediction)) %>%\n  ggplot() + geom_col(aes(word, n)) + \n  facet_wrap(~prediction, scales = 'free') +\n    scale_x_reordered()+\n    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))+ coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nJoining with `by = join_by(word)`\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tidymodels_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-30-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAdvertisements often contain an address, including the word 'street', unlike articles. This matches the findings from the top features, above. Advertisements also often specify an exact time and date, resulting in higher counts of the word 'o'clock'.\n\n## Analyze the Proportion of Advertisements in Each Newspaper Issue\n\nFinally, we analyze the proportion of advertisements in each newspaper issue. We group the articles by their `newspaper_id` and `date`, calculate the proportion of advertisements in each issue, and then compute the mean proportion for each newspaper. This analysis helps us understand the prevalence of advertisements in different newspapers over time.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_df$type = new_ads_to_check$.pred_class\n\nnews_df =news_df  %>% mutate(count = str_count(text))\n\nnews_df =news_df  %>% mutate(issue_code = paste0(newspaper_id, \"_\", date))\n\nnews_df %>% \n  group_by(newspaper_title, issue_code, type) %>%\n  summarise(n = sum(count)) %>%\n  mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %>% \n  group_by(newspaper_title, type) %>% \n  summarise(mean_prop = mean(prop)) %>% \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_col(aes(x = str_trunc(newspaper_title,30), y = mean_prop, fill = type)) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'newspaper_title', 'issue_code'.
