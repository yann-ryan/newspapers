Doing this with newspaper data may help to discover and quantify trends, understand more about events, and make comparisons between the language in several titles. In this tutorial, we'll use text mining to look for changing patterns in word use across the months of a single year.\n\nWe should also think about the specific nature of each newspaper, and how this will affect the results. These are from a single year, but some are much more frequent than others. One, *The Sun*, is a daily, and so much more of the data comes from this title. They will also have different levels of OCR errors.\n\nFor this tutorial, you'll make use of a few more R packages: `tidyverse`, which you should already have installed, `data.table`, and `tidytext`. If necessary, install these using the `install.packages()` command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages('tidyverse')\ninstall.packages('data.table')\ninstall.packages('tidytext')\ninstall.packages('tidytable')\n```\n:::\n\n\nOnce this is done (or if you have them installed already, load them:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(tidytext)\nlibrary(tidytable)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Load the news dataframe and relevant libraries\n\nFor this tutorial, you'll need a set of .csv files containing newspaper article text in a specific format. [Chapter -@sec-download] and [Chapter -@sec-extract] walk through the processing of downloading and creating these files. If you want to construct your own newspaper corpus and use it for this chapter, I recommend going back and checking those out. Alternatively, if you want to use a ready-made corpus, you can download a compressed file containing all the articles from a single year on the repository: 1855. This file is available on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8262355). Once you have downloaded it, decompress it and make a note of where it is stored on your local machine.\n\nThe first step is to load all these files and turn them into a single dataframe. The command `list.files()`, with the parameters set below, will list all the files with the text `csv` in them: Swap the `path=` parameter for the location you have saved the .csv files, if appropriate.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_sample_dataframe = list.files(path = \"newspaper_text\", \n                                   pattern = \"csv\", \n                                   recursive = TRUE, \n                                   full.names = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, import the files themselves. The function `lapply` is a bit like a loop: it will take list or a vector (in this case, a vector containing the file names we want to import), and run the same function over them all, storing the result as a list. In this case, we'll run the function `fread`, which will read a single file into R as a dataframe. Passing it a list of filenames means it will read all of them into dataframes, and store them as a list of dataframes.\n\nWith this list of dataframes, we'll use another function `rbindlist` to transform them from a list of dataframes to a single, long dataframe. Essentially, merging them together.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nall_files = lapply(news_sample_dataframe, data.table::fread) \n\nnames(all_files) = news_sample_dataframe\n\nall_files_df = data.table::rbindlist(all_files, idcol = 'filename')\n```\n:::\n\n\nMake a new object, `news_df`, which takes the information about the newspaper found in the filename, and uses it as metadata, stored in columns.\n\nOne first step is to get the actual title names for the titles. The information in the .csv only contains a unique code, the NLP. To do this, we'll make a small dataframe with the title names and NLP codes, and then join this to the data.\n\nThe result is a dataframe with a column for the issue date, the article number, and the full article text.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntitle_names_df = tibble(newspaper_id = c('0002090', '0002194', '0002244', '0002642', '0002645', '0003089', '0002977'), newspaper_title = c('The Liverpool Standard And General Commercial Advertiser', 'The Sun', 'Colored News', 'The Express', 'The Press', 'Glasgow Courier', 'Swansea and Glamorgan Herald'))\n\nnews_df = all_files_df %>% \n  mutate(filename = basename(filename))\n\n\nnews_df = news_df %>% \n  separate(filename, \n           into = c('newspaper_id', 'date'), sep = \"_\") %>% # separate the filename into two columns\n  mutate(date = str_remove(date, \"\\\\.csv\")) %>% # remove .csv from the new data column\n  select(newspaper_id, date, art, text) %>% \n  mutate(date = ymd(date)) %>% # turn the date column into date format\n  mutate(article_code = 1:n()) %>% # give every article a unique code\n  select(article_code, everything()) %>% \n  left_join(title_names_df, by = 'newspaper_id')# select all columns but with the article code first \n```\n:::\n\n\n## Text Analysis with Tidytext\n\nThe package we're going to use for analysing the text is called 'tidytext'. This package has many features for understanding and working with text, such as tokenising (splitting into words) and calculating the tf-idf scores of words in a group of documents. The authors of the package have published an entire book, [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/), which is a very good introduction to text analysis with R.\n\nIt's a little different to the approach taken by, say, python, because it works on the principle of turning text into dataframes, in a format which is easy to work with in R. When we tokenise, for example, tidytext will create a dataframe which contains one row for each token. This is then easy to count, sort, filter, and so forth, using standard tidyverse tools.\n\nSimple word counts as a method are increasingly outdated, and modern text analysis is much more likely to use more sophisticated metrics and take the context into account. But a simple statistical analysis of text is still a useful and quick way of understanding a group of documents and getting an overview of their contents. It also is often the first step in further analysis, such as topic modelling or word embeddings.\n\nAs a first step, take a look at the first few entries in the dataframe:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_df %>% mutate(text = str_trunc(text, 500)) %>% # show just the first part of the text for displaying in a dataframe\n  head(5) %>% # show the first 5 rows \n  kableExtra::kbl()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> article_code </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> newspaper_id </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> date </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> art </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> text </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> newspaper_title </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1855-06-19 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> esP  e  allall  J  o  Po&amp;#34;'  .d.  o  f  f  t/'  ea  tice  11,  P  ate°  s'  ide  r  ice  F  r  tl  e  i  e'l.fr  't  'e  '  cVi  c°  P  tc  rj  t  ,  irit'tbhe  el.,  j  t  0  P  ,  te  O  P.  o3g  e  r  ti  2b111„,1,P </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> The Liverpool Standard And General Commercial Advertiser </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1855-06-19 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Eqp  t  ,  I  ,  WILLIAMSON-SQUARE.  i'lle  .

Each row is a different article, and the fifth column `text`, contains the full text of that article. You'll also probably notice that the text itself is pretty garbled, because of OCR errors. It's worth pointing out that because we're looking at the first few articles, which are usually advertisements, the OCR is likely to be much worse than with ordinary articles within the paper.\n\nAs a first task, we'll simply use the tidytext package to make a count of the words found in the data.\n\n## Tokenise the text using unnest_tokens()\n\nThe first step is to *tokenise* the text. This is the starting point for many of the basic text analyses which will follow. Tokenising simply divides the text into 'tokens': smaller, equally-sized 'units' of some text. A unit is often a word, but could be a bigram (a sequence of two consecutive words), or a trigram, a sequence of three consecutive words.\n\nTo do this using the library `tidytext`, we will pass the dataframe of text to the function `unnest_tokens()`. This function takes a column of text in a dataframe and splits it into tokens. The function has a set of default values, but, as we will see, we can change the function to create other types of functions.\n\nTo understand what tokenising is doing, I'll make a dataframe containing a single 'article', which in this case is a single sentence.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf = tibble(article_code = 1, text = \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.\")\n\ndf %>% \n  kableExtra::kbl()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> article_code </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> text </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo tokenise this dataframe, we'll use the `unnest_tokens` function. The two most important parameters to `unnest_tokens` are `output` and `input`. This is fairly self-explanatory. Pass the name of the column you'd like to tokenise as the `input`, and the name you would like to give the tokenised words as the `output`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf %>% \n  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = text) %>% \n  kableExtra::kbl()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> article_code </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> word </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> the </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> quick </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> brown </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> fox </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> jumped </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> over </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> the </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> lazy </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> dog </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nRun this code, and you'll see that the dataframe has been transformed. Each word in the sentence is now on a separate row, in a new column called `word`. Also note that the other data (in this case the article code) is kept and duplicated.\n\nYou can also specify an argument for `token`, allowing you to split the text into sentences, characters, lines, or n-grams. If you split into `n-grams`, you need to use the argument `n=` to specify how many consecutive words you'd like to use.\n\nLike this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf %>% \n  unnest_tokens(output = word, \n                input = text, \n                token = 'ngrams', \n                n =3) %>% \n  kableExtra::kbl()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> article_code </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> word </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> the quick brown </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> quick brown fox </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> brown fox jumped </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> fox jumped over </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> jumped over the </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> over the lazy </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> the lazy dog </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can also use other tokenizers such as [character shingles](https://docs.ropensci.org/tokenizers/reference/shingle-tokenizers.html), or supply your own method for splitting the text, such as on new lines, if you have them in your text:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf = tibble(article_code = 1, text = \"The quick brown fox\\njumped over the lazy dog.\")\n\ndf %>% \n  unnest_tokens(output = word, \n                input = text, token = stringr::str_split, pattern = \"\\n\") %>% \n  kableExtra::kbl()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> article_code </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> word </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> the quick brown fox </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> jumped over the lazy dog. </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, it's time to do this to our article text.

However, doing this with a dataframe of 66 million rows is not ideal. For this, we'll introduce a new package, called `tidytable`. Tidytable allows us to use tidyverse verbs, but it translates them into another package, `data.table`, behind the scenes. Data.table is much faster in most cases.\n\nTo use the tidytable equivalent to a tidyverse verb, add a period (`.`) just before the parentheses. For example, `mutate()` becomes `mutate.()`\n\nNote that tidytable does not have a `group_by` command. Instead, you'll use the parameter `.by =` within another command to specify the group you want it to apply to.\n\nOnce this is done, it is relatively easy to count and analyse the data using standard tidyverse verbs. The following will count the instances of each word and show them in descending order:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_tokens %>% \n  summarise.(n = n.(), .by = word) %>% \n  arrange.(desc.(n)) %>% head(20) %>% \n  kableExtra::kbl()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> word </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> n </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> the </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4483357 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> of </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2473323 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> to </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1674183 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> and </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1625027 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> a </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1097019 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> in </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 977684 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> that </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 593476 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> at </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 530306 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> i </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 529302 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> for </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 471661 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> be </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 467150 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> was </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 456650 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> on </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 454623 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> is </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 453208 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> by </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 415020 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> it </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 413959 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> with </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 341337 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> e </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 334563 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> t </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 332604 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 329737 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs you can see, the top words are entirely made up of short, common words such as `the`, `of`, `i`, and so forth. These are unlikely to tell us much about the text or reveal patterns about the content (though they may have other uses, for example for identifying authors, but let's ignore that for now).\n\nTo get something more meaningful out of these top results, it's probably best to do some text cleaning.\n\nWhen doing your own research, particularly using sources such as newspapers which will often look quite different and have messy OCR, you'll often need to go back and forth, checking and adding additional cleaning and pre-processing steps to get something meaningful.\n\nIn this case, we'll remove these short, common words (known as 'stop words'), and also, later, do some more text cleaning.\n\n## Removing stop words\n\nTo do this, we load a dataframe of stopwords, which is included in the tidytext package:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(\"stop_words\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis will load a dataframe called `stop_words` into the R environment. This dataframe contains a column called `word`. We want to merge this to our tokenised data, and remove any matches.\n\nNext use the function `anti_join()`. This basically removes any word in our word list which is also in the stop words list:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_tokens = news_tokens %>% \n  anti_join(stop_words)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nJoining with `by = join_by(word)`\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's take another look at the top words, using the same code as above:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_tokens %>% \n  summarise.(n = n.(), .by = word) %>% \n  arrange.(desc.(n)) %>% head(20)%>% \n  kableExtra::kbl()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> word </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> n </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 329737 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 205696 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 200869 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> amp </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 152582 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 99579 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 6 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 84694 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 11 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 84643 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> day </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 84447 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 81151 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 80543 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> lord </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 78383 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> street </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 75711 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 10 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 73835 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> time </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 68863 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> st </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 68110 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 7 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 67775 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> london </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 67363 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> house </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 59095 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> war </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 56102 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> de </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 53433 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow the stopwords are removed, we can use the `filter()` command to remove any other unwanted tokens: numbers are also particularly common in newspapers (these titles often publish lists of stocks and shipping information, for example) and don't tell us anything about the texts. Furthermore, ssome horizontal lines have been picked up by the OCR as punctuation. Let's filter both of these out:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_tokens = news_tokens %>% \n  filter(!str_detect(word, \"[0-9]\")) %>% \n  filter(!str_detect(word, \"__\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe command `str_detect()` within \\`filter() removes any word which matches a given regular expressions pattern. In this case, the pattern is *simply any occurence of a number*. That's a bit blunt, but it will be effective at least.\n\nLet's check the top words again:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_tokens %>% \n  summarise.(n = n.(), .by = word) %>% \n  arrange.(desc.(n)) %>% head(20) %>% \n  kableExtra::kbl()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> word </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> n </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> amp </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 152582 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> day </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 84447 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> lord </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 78383 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> street </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 75711 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> time </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 68863 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> st </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 68110 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> london </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 67363 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> house </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 59095 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> war </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 56102 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> de </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 53433 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> sir </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 53288 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> john </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 49003 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> sad </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 48236 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> royal </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 45438 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> cent </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 43548 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> government </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 41093 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> public </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 40450 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> esq </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 38063 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> country </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 37544 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> army </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 37313 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe list looks a bit more sensible now, with words which are plausibly found often particularly within news sources.\n\n## Visualising using ggplot\n\nThe next step is to visualise this, which is very easy to do using `ggplot2`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_tokens %>% \n  summarise.(n = n.(), .by = word) %>% \n  arrange.(desc.(n)) %>% head(20) %>% \n  ggplot() + geom_col(aes(x = reorder(word, n),y = n)) + coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](term-freq_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs well as a basic count of everything, we can use tidyverse/tidytable to do some more specific counts and visualisations.\n\nFor example, a count of the top five words for each month in the data. For this, we need to create a 'month' column, and use `facet_wrap()` from ggplot2 to graph each month separately. In order to have the results show correctly, we make use of the function `reorder_within` from the tidytext package. This is to ensure that the words are properly ordered within each facet, rather than overall.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_tokens %>% \n  mutate(month = as.character(cut(date, 'month')))%>% \n  summarise.(n = n.(), .by = c(month, word)) %>% \n  group_by(month) %>% \n  slice_max(order_by = n, n = 10)  %>% \n    mutate(month = as.factor(month),\n           word = reorder_within(word, n, month))%>% \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_col(aes(x = reorder(word, n), y = n)) + \n  coord_flip() + \n  facet_wrap(~month, scales = 'free_y')+\n    scale_x_reordered()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](term-freq_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can also get the top words per newspaper title:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_tokens %>% \n  summarise.(n = n.(), .by = c(newspaper_title, word)) %>% \n  group_by(newspaper_title) %>% \n  slice_max(order_by = n, n = 10) %>% \n    mutate(newspaper_title = as.factor(newspaper_title),\n           word = reorder_within(word, n, newspaper_title))%>% \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_col(aes(x = reorder(word, n), y = n)) + \n  coord_flip() + \n  facet_wrap(~newspaper_title, scales = 'free')+\n    scale_x_reordered()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](term-freq_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see some differences between the titles, although many of the word lists are quite similar. Many of these are typical words which appear in advertisements or report - words related to times or places (street, day, clock, etc.). There are also regional differences, with the place associated with the title (`glasgow`, `swansea`, `liverpool` etc.) also showing up. One title, 0002645, seems to have more words related to 'serious' news (`war`, `government`). Some further cleaning or adding words to the stop word list would be helpful too, clearly.\n\n### Change over time\n\nAnother thing to look at is the change in individual words over time. 'War' is a common word: did its use change over the year? To do this, we first filter the token dataframe, using `filter()` to keep only the word (or words) we're interested in.\n\nIn many cases (as definitely here), the spread of data over the entire period is not even - some months have many more words than others. For an analysis to be in any way meaningful, you should think of some way of normalising the results, so that the number is of a percentage of the total words in that title, for example. The raw numbers may just indicate a change in the total volume of text.\n\nWe'll do this with an extra step. First, make a count of the total number of each word, per week. Second, make a new column which divides the total per word, by the total number of words per week. This number is the frequency - basically what proportion of the total words for that week is a particular word. Lastly, filter to just the word of interest:\n\n### Words over time\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_tokens %>%\n    mutate.(week = ymd(cut(date, 'week'))) %>% \n    summarise.(n = n(), .by = c(word, week))  %>%\n    mutate.(freq = n/sum(n), .by = week) %>% \n    filter.(word == 'war') %>% \n    ggplot() + geom_col(aes(x = week, y = freq))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Chart of the Word 'ship' over time](term-freq_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can also look at very seasonal words, to test whether it really makes sense:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_tokens %>%\n    mutate.(week = ymd(cut(date, 'week'))) %>% \n    summarise.(n = n(), .by = c(word, week))  %>%\n    mutate.(freq = n/sum(n), .by = week) %>% \n    filter.(word == 'christmas') %>% \n    ggplot() + geom_col(aes(x = week, y = freq))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](term-freq_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, there is a seasonal pattern to the word `christmas` in the dataset.\n\nCounting tokens like this in many cases says more about the dataset and its collection than anything about the content or the historical context. In fact, many of the words seem to be coming from advertisements rather than news articles. In a future chapter, we'll build a classifier to detect these and remove them.\n\n## Tf-idf\n\nThis section deals uses R and tidytext to do another very typical word frequency analysis, known as the **tf-idf** score. This is a measurement of how 'unique' a word is in a given document, by comparing its frequency in one document to its frequency overall. Counting tokens, as above, will generally result in a listen of very popular words, which occur very often in all newspapers, and so don't really give any interesting information. Using a metric such as tf-idf can be a way to understand the most 'significant' words within a given document.\n\nIn this case, the word *document* can be misleading. It could be a single issue or article, or it could be something completely different, depending on our needs. A document can be any way of splitting up the text. For instance, we could consider all articles from a given month as a single 'document', and then calculate the words most unique to that month. This might give us a better understanding of what unique topics were being discussed at a particular time in the newspapers.\n\nTo do this, we use a function from tidytext called `bind_tf_idf`. This function expects a list of words per document and a raw count. We'll do this as a first step. To keep things simple, we'll use the newspaper ID as the 'document', meaning the metric should find words unique to each title. First, create a new object `news_tokens_count`, which contains the counts of the words in each newspaper ID:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_tokens_count = news_tokens %>% \n  count(newspaper_id, word)\n\nnews_tokens_count %>% head(10) %>% \n  kableExtra::kbl()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> newspaper_id </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> word </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> n </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _a </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 45 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _a_ </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _aa </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _aaa </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _aacislain </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _aad </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _abo </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _about </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _acaltitash </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _accept </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext, use the `bind_tf_idf` function from tidytext. This needs to be passed the word column (`term`), the `document` column, and the column with the word counts (`n`)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_tfidf = news_tokens_count %>% \n  bind_tf_idf(term = word, document = newspaper_id, n = n)\n\nnews_tfidf %>% head(10) %>% \n  kableExtra::kbl()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> newspaper_id </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> word </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> n </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> tf </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> idf </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> tf_idf </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _a </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 45 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.73e-05 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0000000 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0e+00 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _a_ </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4.00e-07 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.5596158 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2e-07 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _aa </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 8.00e-07 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.8472979 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 7e-07 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _aaa </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4.00e-07 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.9459101 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 7e-07 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _aacislain </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4.00e-07 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.9459101 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 7e-07 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _aad </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4.00e-07 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.2527630 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5e-07 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _abo </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4.00e-07 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.9459101 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 7e-07 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _about </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 8.00e-07 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.8472979 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 7e-07 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _acaltitash </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4.00e-07 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.9459101 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 7e-07 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0002090 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> _accept </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4.00e-07 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.9459101 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 7e-07 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, we have a new object with new columns. The first is `tf`, which is simply the frequency of that term as a proportion of all words in the document. Next is `idf`, which is the inverse of the frequency of the word over all the documents. The less frequent a word is overall, the larger the number in this column. Third is `tf_idf`, which multiples one by the other.\n\nTo make use of this, we want to find the words with the highest tf-idf scores for each of the documents. Let's do this and plot the results:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_tfidf %>% \n  group_by(newspaper_id) %>% \n  slice_max(order_by = tf_idf, n = 10) %>% \n  ungroup() %>%\n    mutate(newspaper_id = as.factor(newspaper_id),\n           word = reorder_within(word, tf_idf, newspaper_id)) %>%\n  ggplot() + geom_col(aes(word, tf_idf)) + \n  facet_wrap(~newspaper_id, scales = 'free') +\n    scale_x_reordered()+\n    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))+ coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](term-freq_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere's one final problem worth considering with using tf-idf. A word can score very highly if it occurs just a couple of times in one document and not at all in others. This may mean that the highest tf-idf words are not actually significant but just extremely rare. One solution to this is to filter so that we only consider words that occur at least a few times in the documents:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnews_tfidf %>% \n  filter(n>3) %>% \n  group_by(newspaper_id) %>% \n  slice_max(order_by = tf_idf, n = 10) %>% \n  ungroup() %>%\n    mutate(newspaper_id = as.factor(newspaper_id),\n           word = reorder_within(word, tf_idf, newspaper_id)) %>%\n  ggplot() + geom_col(aes(word, tf_idf)) + \n  facet_wrap(~newspaper_id, scales = 'free') +\n    scale_x_reordered()+\n    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))+ coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](term-freq_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe results are still not very satisfactory - at least at first glance, it's hard to get anything about the\n\n## Small case study {#sec-bigram}\n\nTo demonstrate how counting frequencies can be used as a form of analysis, this section is a small case study looking at bigrams, that is, pairs of words found in the data. Looking at the immediate context of a word can give some clue as to how it is being used. For example, the word 'board' in the bigram 'board game' has a different meaning to the word board in the bigram 'board meeting'.\n\nIn this case study, we'll count bigrams containing the word 'liberal', to see how the meaning of that word changed over time.\n\nBecause we want to look at temporal, or diachronic change, we'll need a different datatset to the year 1855 used in the chapter so far. Instead, we'll use a dataset containing all the issues of a single title *The Sun*, for the years 1802 and 1870. These are the earliest and latest years in the data, and using one title means it's more likely we'll have at least slightly consistent results.\n\nI have already extracted the text from these years and they are available as .zip file here. Once you have downloaded this, decompress and put the path to the folder name in the code below. Otherwise, follow the same steps as in the code at the beginning of the chapter.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntheSun = list.files(path = \"../../../Downloads/TheSun_sample/\", \n                                   pattern = \"csv\", \n                                   recursive = TRUE, \n                                   full.names = TRUE)\n\ntheSunall_files =   lapply(theSun, data.table::fread) \n\nnames(theSunall_files) = theSun\n\ntheSunall_files_df = data.table::rbindlist(theSunall_files, idcol = 'filename')\n\ntheSunall_files_df = theSunall_files_df %>% \n  mutate(filename = basename(filename))\n\ntheSunall_files_df = theSunall_files_df %>% \n  separate(filename, \n           into = c('newspaper_id', 'date'), sep = \"_\") %>% # separate the filename into two columns\n  mutate(date = str_remove(date, \"\\\\.csv\")) %>% # remove .csv from the new data column\n  select(newspaper_id, date, art, text) %>% \n  mutate(date = ymd(date)) %>% # turn the date column into date format\n  mutate(article_code = 1:n()) %>% # give every article a unique code\n  select(article_code, everything()) %>% \n  left_join(title_names_df, by = 'newspaper_id')# select all columns but with the article code first \n```\n:::\n\n\nUse `unnest_tokens` to tokenise the data. Set the `n` parameter to 2, which will divide the text into bigrams:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntheSunNgrams = theSunall_files_df %>% \n  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = 'ngrams', n =2)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWith this new dataset, filter to include only bigrams which contain the word liberal. Count these and visualise the top ten results:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntheSunNgrams %>%\n  filter(str_detect(word, \"^liberal \")) %>% \n  mutate(year = year(date)) %>%\n  count(word, year) %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n  slice_max(order_by = n, n = 10) %>%\n    mutate(year = as.factor(year),\n           word = reorder_within(word, n, year)) %>%\n  ggplot() + geom_col(aes(word, n)) + \n  facet_wrap(~year, scales = 'free') +\n    scale_x_reordered()+\n    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))+ coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](term-freq_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe results point to a huge change in the way that the word liberal is used in these two years of the newspaper. At the beginning of the century, the most common bigrams point to the general meaning of the word liberal, but by the end, the words are all related to liberal as a political ideology and party.\n\n## Further reading\n\nThe best place to learn more is by reading the 'Tidy Text Mining' book available at https://www.tidytextmining.com.
